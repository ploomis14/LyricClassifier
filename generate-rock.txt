butterflies and needles in her skin i turn with an ugly grin
there's a bustle in your kihn
makes me a sad girl
like whorl

like chocolate
dynalites jackrabbit
please keep going courtney for frances
offer me my revisionists

offer me my aslan
on the aslan
what's the point of language
iris swims quietly beside sauvage
