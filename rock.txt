I miss the taste of a sweeter life

I miss the conversation

I'm searching for a song tonight

I'm changing all of the stations

I like to think that we had it all

We drew a map to a better place

But on that road I took a fall

Oh baby why did you run away?
I was there for you

In your darkest times

I was there for you

In your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you

When I was at my worst

Down on my knees

And you said you had my back

So I wonder where were you

All the roads you took came back to me

So I'm following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you

Ain't nothing I can do

The map that leads to you

Following, following, following to you

The map that leads to you

Ain't nothing I can do

The map that leads to you

Following, following, following
I hear your voice in my sleep at night

Hard to resist temptation

'Cause all these strangers come over me

Now I can't get over you

No I just can't get over you
I was there for you

In your darkest times

I was there for you

In your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you

When I was at my worst

Down on my knees

And you said you had my back

So I wonder where were you

All the roads you took came back to me

'Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars

I'm gonna give you my heart

'Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars

'Cause you light up the path
I don't care, go on and tear me apart

I don't care if you do

'Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars

I think I saw you
'Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars

I want to die in your arms, arms

'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark

I'm going to give you my heart
And I don't care, go on and tear me apart

And I don't care if you do

'Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars

I think I see you

I think I see you
Because you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars

Such a heavenly view

You're such a heavenly view
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies

And I'm not proud of my address

In the torn up town, no post code envy
But every song's like:

Gold teeth

Grey Goose

Tripping in the bathroom

Bloodstains

Ball gowns

Trashing the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like:

Crystal

Maybach

Diamonds on your timepiece

Jet planes

Islands

Tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)

It don't run in our blood

That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler (ruler)

You can call me queen bee

And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule

Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I we've cracked the code

We count our dollars on the train to the party

And everyone who knows us knows

That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money
But every song's like:

Gold teeth

Grey Goose

Tripping in the bathroom

Bloodstains

Ball gowns

Trashing the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like:

Crystal

Maybach

Diamonds on your timepiece

Jet planes

Islands

Tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)

It don't run in our blood

That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler (ruler)

You can call me queen bee

And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule

Let me live that fantasy
ooh ooh oh ooh

We're better than we've every dreamed

And I'm in love with being queen
ooh ooh oh ooh

Life is great without a care

We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)

It don't run in our blood

That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler (ruler)

You can call me queen bee

And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule

Let me live that fantasy
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry

You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you, tell you I need you

Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions

Oh, let's go back to the start

Running in circles, coming up tails

Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy

It's such a shame for us to part

Nobody said it was easy

No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures

Pulling the puzzles apart

Questions of science, science and progress

Do not speak as loud as my heart
And tell me you love me, come back and haunt me

Oh when I rush to the start

Running in circles, chasing up tails

Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy

Oh, it's such a shame for us to part

Nobody said it was easy

No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ah ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
[Gotye]

Now and then I think of when we were together

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die

Told myself that you were right for me

But felt so lonely in your company

But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

Like resignation to the end, always the end

So when we found that we could not make sense

Well you said that we would still be friends

But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

And I don't even need your love

But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low

Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

I guess that I don't need that though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[Kimbra]

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over

But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way

Reading into every word you say

You said that you could let it go

And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
[Gotye]

But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

And I don't even need your love

But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

And you didn't have to stoop so low

Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

I guess that I don't need that though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody

(I used to know)

Somebody

(Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
(I used to know)

(That I used to know)

(I used to know)

Somebody
Hey now call it a spliff 'cause you know that you will

Oh you bite your friends like chocolate

You say, we'll go where nobody knows, with guns hidden under our petticoat

No we're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no
Now we run run away from the boys in the blue, and my car smells like chocolate

Hey now think about what to do, think about what to say, think about how to think

Pause it play, pause it play, pause it
Oh we go where nobody knows, with guns hidden under our petticoats

No we're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no

Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe, we've got guns hidden under our petticoats

No we're never gunna' quit it. no we're never gunna' quit it no
Now you're never gunna' quit it, now you're never gunna' quit it, now you're never gunna' quit it

If you don't start smoking it, that's what she said

She said we're dressed in black, from head to toe, with guns hidden under our petticoats

No we're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no
Hey now we're building up speed as we're approaching the hill

Oh my hair smells like chocolate

Hey now you say you're gunna' quit it but you're never gunna' quit it

Gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, go!

And play it cool
Oh and you said we go where nobody knows, with guns hidden under our petticoats

No we're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no

Yeah we're dressed in black, from head to toe, we've got guns hidden under our petticoats

We're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no
Well I think we better go, seriously better go

Said the feds are here you know

Seriously better go, oh oh, well I think we better go

Said the feds are here you know

Said Rebecca better know

Seriously better go
We go where nobody knows, with guns hidden under our petticoats

No we're never gunna' quit it, no we're never gunna' quit it no

Yeah we're dressed in black, head to toe, guns hidden under our petticoats

No we're never gunna' quit it. no we're never gunna' quit it no

No no no
Well I think we better go, seriously better go

Said the feds are here you know

Seriously better go, oh oh, well I think we better go

Said the feds are here you know

Said Rebecca better know

Seriously better go
Do you hear me? I'm talking to you

Across the water across the deep blue ocean

Under the open sky, oh my, oh baby I'm trying
Boy I hear you in my dreams

I feel your whisper across the sea

I keep you with me in my heart

You make it easier when life gets hard
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend

Lucky to have been where I have been

Lucky to be coming home again

Ooh ooh ooh
They don't know how long it takes,

Waiting for a love like this

Every time we say goodbye

I wish we had one more kiss

I'll wait for you I promise you, I

will
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend

Lucky to have been where I have been

Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way

Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed

Lucky to be coming home someday
And so I'm sailing through the sea

To an island where we'll meet

You'll hear the music fill the air

I'll put a flower in your hair
Though the breezes through the trees

Move so pretty you're all I see

As the world keeps spinning 'round

You hold me, right here, right now
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend

Lucky to have been where I have been

Lucky to be coming home again
I'm lucky we're in love in every way

Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed

Lucky to be coming home someday
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh

Ooh ooh ooh,ooh,
(Ooh, Ooh-Ooh, Ooh)
I had a dream so big and loud

I jumped so high I touched the clouds

Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
I stretched my hands out to the sky

We danced with monsters through the night

Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)

Never gonna give it up, No-Oh

And then the sun came crashing in

Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
But all the possibilities

No limits just epiphanies

Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)

The stars were burning so bright

The sun was out 'till midnight

I say we lose control (Control)

(Ooh, Ooh-Ooh, Ooh)

When you try your best but you don't succeed

When you get what you want but not what you need

When you feel so tired but you can't sleep

Stuck in reverse
When the tears come streaming down your face

When you lose something you can't replace

When you love someone but it goes to waste

Could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home

And ignite your bones

I will try to fix you
High up above or down below

When you're too in love to let it go

But if you never try you'll never know

Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home

And ignite your bones

And I will try to fix you
Tears stream down your face

When you lose something you cannot replace

Tears stream down your face

And I
Tears stream down your face

I promise you I will learn from my mistakes

Tears stream down your face

And I
Lights will guide you home

And ignite your bones

And I will try to fix you
When the days are cold

And the cards all fold

And the saints we see

Are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail

And the ones we hail

Are the worst of all

And the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth

I wanna shelter you

But with the beast inside

There's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed

We still are made of greed

This is my kingdom come

This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat

Look into my eyes

It's where my demons hide

It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close

It's dark inside

It's where my demons hide

It's where my demons hide
At the curtains call

It's the last of all

When the lights fade out

All the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave

And the masquerade

Will come calling out

At the mess you've made
Don't wanna let you down

But I am, hell bound

Though this is all for you

Don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed

We still are made of greed

This is my kingdom come

This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat

Look into my eyes

It's where my demons hide

It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close

It's dark inside

It's where my demons hide

It's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make

I say it's up to fate

It's woven in my soul

I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright

I wanna save that light

I can't escape this now

Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat

Look into my eyes

It's where my demons hide

It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close

It's light inside

It's where my demons hide

It's where my demons hide
I'm coming out of my cage

And I've been doing just fine

Gotta gotta be damned

Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss

How did it end up like this?

It was only a kiss

It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep

And she's calling a cab

While he's having a smoke

And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed

And my stomach is sick

And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest now

He takes off her dress now

Let me go
I just can't look it's killing me

And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea

Swimming through sick lullabies

Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay

Destiny is calling me

Open up my eager eyes

Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I'm coming out of my cage

And I've been doing just fine

Gotta gotta be down

Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss

How did it end up like this?

It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep

And she's calling a cab

While he's having a smoke

And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed

And my stomach is sick

And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest now

He takes off her dress now

Let me go
Cause I just can't look it's killing me

And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea

Swimming through sick lullabies

Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay

Destiny is calling me

Open up my eager eyes

Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I never

I never

I never

I never!
Look at the stars

Look how they shine for you

And everything you do

Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along

I wrote a song for you

And all the things you do

And it was called 'Yellow'
So then I took my turn

Oh what a thing to have done

And it was all yellow
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones

Turn it to, to something beautiful

Do you know? You know I love you so

You know I love you so
I swam across

I jumped across for you

Oh what a thing to do

'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line

I drew a line for you

Oh what a thing to do

And it was all yellow
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones

Turn it to, to something beautiful

D'you know? For you I'd bleed myself dry

For you I'd bleed myself dry
It's true

Look how they shine for you

Look how they shine for you

Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you

Look how they shine for you

Look how they shine
Look at the stars

Look how they shine for you

And all the things that you do
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it

I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted

Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest

And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention

I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more

It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me

Open up your plans and damn you're free

Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing

We're just one big family

And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved love love
So I won't hesitate no more, no more

It cannot wait, I'm sure

There's no need to complicate, our time is short

This is our fate, I'm yours
D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do

But do you want to come on

Scooch on over closer dear

And I will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer

But my breath fogged up the glass

And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons

It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more, no more

It cannot wait, I'm yours

Open up your mind and see like me

(I won't hesitate)

Open up your plans and damn you're free

(No more, no more)

Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours

(It cannot wait, I'm sure)
So please don't please don't, there's no need

(There's no need to complicate)

There's no need to complicate

(Our time is short)

Our time is short

(This is our fate)

This is, this is, this is our fate

I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours

Oh, I'm yours

Oh, whoa, baby you believe I'm yours

You best believe, best believe I'm yours
I used to rule the world

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Now in the morning I sleep alone

Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

Listen as the crowd would sing

"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key

Next the walls were closed on me

And I discovered that my castles stand

Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror, my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain

Once you're gone there was never

Never an honest word

But that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind

Blew down the doors to let me in

Shattered windows and the sound of drums

People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait

For my head on a silver plate

Just a puppet on a lonely string

Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror, my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Never an honest word

But that was when I ruled the world

Woahahahah oh, woahahah oh

Woahahahah oh, woahahah oh,

Woahahahah
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror, my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Never an honest word

But that was when I ruled the world
ooooooh ooh oooooh oh ooooooh oh oooooh ooh.
When the night has come

And the land is dark

And the moon is the only light we'll see

No, I won't be afraid

Oh, I won't be afraid

Just as long as you stand, stand by me
So darling, darling

Stand by me, oh stand by me

Oh stand, stand by me

Stand by me
If the sky, that we look upon

Should tumble and fall

And the mountain should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry

No, I won't shed a tear

Just as long as you stand, stand by me
And darling, darling

Stand by me, oh stand by me

Oh stand now, stand by me

Stand by me
So darling, darling

Stand by me, oh stand by me

Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me

Oh stand by me, oh won't you stand now, stand

Stand by me

Stand by me
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away

Now it looks as though they're here to stay

oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be

There's a shadow hanging over me

Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
Why she had to go?

I don't know, she wouldn't say

I said something wrong

Now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play

Now I need a place to hide away

Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Why she had to go?

I don't know, she wouldn't say

I said something wrong

Now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play

Now I need a place to hide away

Oh, I believe in yesterday...
