My lover's got humour

She's the giggle at a funeral

Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the Heavens ever did speak

She is the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak

A fresh poison each week

"We were born sick", you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me "worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to

Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
Amen, Amen, Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death

Good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times

My lover's the sunlight
To drain the whole sea

Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course

That's a fine looking high horse

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty

That looks plenty

This is hungry work
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene

Only then I am human

Only then I am clean
Amen, Amen, Amen
What doesn't kill you

Makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take

One more moment of this silence

The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold up
It comes in waves

I close my eyes

Hold my breath

And let it bury me
I'm not ok

And it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake

And bring me home again
Who will fix me now?

Dive in when I'm down?

Save me from myself

Don't let me drown
Who will make me fight?

Drag me out alive?

Save me from myself

Don't let me drown
What doesn't destroy you

Leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper

And I can't take

One more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up
You know that I can't do this on my own

You know that I can't do this on my own

You know that I can't do this on my own

You know that I can't do this on my own

Who will fix me now

Who will fix me now
I find it hard to say bye-bye

Even in the state of you and I

And how can I refuse?
Yeah you rid me of the blues

Ever since you came into my life



Because you’re my medicine

(Yeah, you’re a medicine)

Yeah, you’re a medicine

(You’re a medicine)
I, I wanna marry you

Said I, I adore you

And that’s all I have to say bye-bye
And you opiate this hazy head of mine
Don't get me started love

I've had too much to drink

Had too much time to think

So leave me alone
Crying when you're by yourself

Cause of what they think

About you

Makes time go slow slow slow

Makes time go slow slow slow

Slow
Something's gotta give soon

Or I'm gonna lose it

Substance abusing

And never come down
Fall off the deep end

And forget my English
What's the point of language

If you don't say what you feel
Doses and Mimosas

Champagne and cocaine

Help to get me through
Ten in the morning

And I'm skipping breakfast

And drinking a beverage

To ignore it all
Guess ignorance is bliss and

I've come to embrace it

It's all overrated

Except drugs and alcohol
When your legs don't work like they used to before

And I can't sweep you off of your feet

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till we're 70

And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23

And I'm thinking about how
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades

And the crowds don't remember my name

When my hands don't play the strings the same way

I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

And I'm thinking about how
People fall in love in mysterious ways

And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh baby, we found love right where we are

And we found love right where we are
I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a bean bag
Turn you inside out to lick you like a crisp packet
You're the first and last of your kind
I want to be every lever you pull

And all showers that shower you
I'm gonna paw, paw at you

Like a cat paws at my woolen jumper
Be your Minpin
Devour me
Lou, Lou, let the cover girls sing!
Yes I'm gonna roll around you

Like a cat rolls around saw dusted patios
I'm gonna kiss you

Like the sun browns you
Devour me

Devour me

If you really think that you can stomach me
I want every other freckle (x7)

I want every other freckle, freckle
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week

How many secrets can you keep?
Cause there's this tune I found

That makes me think of you somehow

And I play it on repeat

Until I fall asleep

Spilling drinks on my settee
(Do I wanna know?)

If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)

Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know)

That the nights were mainly made

For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day
Crawlin' back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?

Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new

Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you
So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open

And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp

Of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do

We could be together if you wanted to
(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy bein' yours to fall
Ever thought of callin' darlin'
(Do I wanna know?)
Do you want me crawlin' back to you?
I was scared of dentists and the dark

I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green

You're the magician's assistant in their dreams
Oh, and they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide

Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and

I got a lump in my throat cause

You're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like

This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City

This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
Oh, and they come unstuck
I swear she's destined for the screen

Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
You’re on your own

In a world you’ve grown
Few more years to go

Don’t let the hurdle fall
So be the girl you loved

Be the girl you loved
I’ll wait

So show me while you’re strong
Ignore everybody else

We’re alone now
I’ll wait

So show me while you’re strong

Ignore everybody else

We’re alone now
Suddenly I’m hit

Is this darkness or the dawn?

And your friends are gone

And your friends won’t come
So show me where you fit

So show me where you fit

Heat shimmers

Hips quiver

Open smother

Lipped lover
Dead in the middle of the C-O-double-M-O-N

Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys

Soon become Mandela Men
Razor blades on a melted toothbrush

Slash, slash/Assassin de la police

Heat shimmers

Silky glistener

Open smother

Lipped lover
Dead in the middle of the C-O-double-M-O-N

Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys

Soon become Mandela Men

Silent knife, unholy knife

I’ve fallen for the black outside my window

On the C-O-double-M-O-N

On the C-O-double-M-O-N
A flood of blood to the heart (x16)
Quelea, quelea (x12)
(Improvised lyrics)
Sleeplessly embracing

Butterflies and needles

Line my seamed-up join
Encased in case I need it

In my stomach, for my heart

Chain mail
Hunger of the pine
Yawn yearns into me
Plenty more tears in the sea
And so you finally use it

Bedding with me you see at night
Your heart wears knight armour
Hunger of the pine
(I'm a female rebel)
Sleeplessly

Embracing

You
Realisation grew on me

As quickly as it takes your hand

To warm the cool side of the pillow
I’m there for you, be there for me

I’ll hum the song the soldiers sing

As they march outside our window
Hunger of the pine
Une immense espérance a traversé la terre

Une immense espérance a traversé ma peur
From the nape of her neck he made his descent
They watched men hurl from rock to sea

Like sternum to button, lined lip pinches in between
Iris swims quietly beside me

Oh the leaves and larger weeds sway and stretch themselves beneath

Blue dragonflies dart to and fro
I tie my life to your balloon and let it go
The image, the session, a poet is sleeping
Ain't shady baby

I'm hot
like the prodigal son
Pick a petal eenie meeny miny mo

And flower you're the chosen one
Well your left hand's free

And your right's in a grip

With another left hand

Watch his right hand slip

Towards his gun

Oh no
I tackle, we tussle

And oh my days we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his

Colt single-action army
N-E-O, O-M-G

Gee whiz, girl you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am

And oh my days he disagrees
(Speak easy)
Ain't shady baby

I'm hot
like the prodigal son
Pick a petal eenie meeny miny mo

And flower you're the chosen one
Well your left hand's free

Well my left hand's free (x4)
She's sticking needles in her skin, I turn with an ugly grin

Maybe I should let her go

But only when she loves me (she loves me)

How can I just let her go?

Not until she loves me (she loves me)
To Boddah
Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee. This note should be pretty easy to understand
All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true.
I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guity beyond words about these things
For example when we're back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins., it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy.
The fact is, I can't fool you, any one of you. It simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100% fun.
Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage.
I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do,God, believe me I do, but it's not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people.
I must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms I once had as a child
On our last 3 tours, I've had a much better appreciation for all the people I've known personally, and as fans of our music, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone.
There's good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad.
The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative,
Pisces,
Jesus man. Why don't you just enjoy it? I don't know!
I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy
and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I've become
I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess
Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach
for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby!
I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember,
it's better to burn out than to fade away
Peace, love, empathy

Kurt Cobain
Frances and Courtney, I'll be at your altar

Please keep going Courtney, for Frances

For her life, which will be so much happier without me
Let's skip all the histrionics

Not again, not another excuse
Life keeps taking things away
"The tough guys who came to kill, but stayed to rape and ravage."
She sees them walking in a straight line, that's not really her style

They all got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible and she's just in the background
And she says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in

I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids
He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they're living the good life, can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going

In the fast lane, living life without knowing

And he says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

And they said
I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in

I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in

I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to get it

I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids
A little baby told God

Hey I'm kinda scared, don't really know if

I wanna go down there
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball
But that's a great big place and I'm so small
Why can't I just stay here with you?

Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?'
'Oh child, of course I do

But there's somebody special that's waiting for you'
So hush now baby don’t you cry
Cuz there’s someone down there waiting who’s only goal in life

Is making you sure you’re always going to be alright

A loving angel tender tough and strong

It’s almost time to go and meet your Mom
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, No escape from reality
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy

Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low

Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head

Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Mama, life had just begun
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango

Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo figaro magnifico
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go

(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go

(Let me go.) Will not let you go

(Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?

So you think you can love me and leave me to die?

Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!

Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I've become
I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess
Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach
for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby!
I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember,
it's better to burn out than to fade away
Peace, love, empathy

Kurt Cobain
Frances and Courtney, I'll be at your altar

Please keep going Courtney, for Frances

For her life, which will be so much happier without me
Let's skip all the histrionics

Not again, not another excuse
Life keeps taking things away
"The tough guys who came to kill, but stayed to rape and ravage."
She sees them walking in a straight line, that's not really her style

They all got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible and she's just in the background
And she says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in

I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids
He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they're living the good life, can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going

In the fast lane, living life without knowing

And he says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

And they said
I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in

I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in

I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to get it

I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids
A little baby told God

Hey I'm kinda scared, don't really know if

I wanna go down there
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball
But that's a great big place and I'm so small
Why can't I just stay here with you?

Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?'
'Oh child, of course I do

But there's somebody special that's waiting for you'
So hush now baby don’t you cry
Cuz there’s someone down there waiting who’s only goal in life

Is making you sure you’re always going to be alright

A loving angel tender tough and strong

It’s almost time to go and meet your Mom
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, No escape from reality
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy

Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low

Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head

Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Mama, life had just begun
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango

Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo figaro magnifico
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go

(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go

(Let me go.) Will not let you go

(Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?

So you think you can love me and leave me to die?

Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!

Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!
Say something, I'm giving up on you

I'll be the one, if you want me to

Anywhere, I would've followed you

Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small

It was over my head

I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall

I'm still learning to love

Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you

I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you

Anywhere, I would've followed you

Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love

And I'm saying goodbye
Say something, I'm giving up on you

Say something...

Du du du du-du du du

Du du du du du-du du du
Some legends are told

Some turn to dust or to gold

But you will remember me

Remember me, for centuries
Just one mistake

Is all it will take

We'll go down in history

Remember me for centuries

Hey, hey, hey

Remember me for centuries
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me

The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in

Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name

Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom

You're about to bloom

You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon
No space

L-shaped

Tetris

Tile seeking

Somewhere

Oh somewhere

To fit in
Alien
Oh, coming out of the woodwork

Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
AK

Twenty

47

Civilian
Jeremiah
Jeremiah
As she submarines

The rope loops round her feeble feet
She never finds her bearings

Sucking splash into her lungs



Though I cannot see

I can hear her smile as she sings



And though I cannot see

I can hear her smile as she sings
Soon

I'm gonna marry a man like no other
Light the fuse, hallelujah, hallelujah
Love

Love is the warmest colour
Petrol blues
hallelujah, hallelujah
Comes

Saut dans le vide, my lover
Love is a pharaoh
He's found me, my Aslan
Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama

Marry a man like no other

Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama

Love is the warmest colour
Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama

Unpin your butterflies, Russia
Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama

To be a deer in Nara
My veins are blue and connected

And every single bone in my brain is electric

But I dig ditches like the best of 'em
Yo trabajo duro

Como en madera y yeso

Como en madera y yeso
And even God herself has fewer plans than me
But she never helps me out with my scams for free, though
She grabs a stick and then she pokes it at me

When I say nothing, I say everything

Yeah when I say nothing, I say everything
They put me down in a lazaretto

Born rotten, bored rotten
Making models of people I used to know

Out of coffee and cotton
And all of my illegitimate kids have begotten

Thrown down to the wolves, made feral for nothing
Quarantined on the Isle Of Man

And I'm trying to escape any way that I can, oh

Any way that I can, oh
And I shake God's hand

I jump up and let her know when I can

This is how I'm gonna do it
They're lighting fires with the cash of the masses
And like the dough I don't fall down
I'm so Detroit I make it rise from the ashes
Being a mistress on the side

It might not appeal to fools like you

Creeping around on the side

Would not be something you would do
But you haven't seen my man

You haven't seen my man

You haven't seen my man

You haven't seen him
He's got the fire and he walks with it

He's got the fire and he talks with it
His bonny on the side, bonny on the side

Makes me a sad, sad girl

His money on the side, money on the side

Makes me a sad, sad girl
I'm a sad girl

I'm a sad girl

I'm a sad girl

I'm a sad girl

I'm a bad girl

I'm a bad girl
Being a bad bitch on the side

Might not appeal to fools like you
Creeping around while he gets high

It might not be something you would do
But you haven't seen my man

You haven't seen my man

You haven't seen my man

You haven't seen him
Watch what you say to me

Careful who you're talking to

Watch what you say to me

Careful who you're talking to

I'm on fire, baby

I'm on fire
And I came to get hurt

Might as well do your worst to me, yeah
And the things once in order now seem so strange
Well it's too long living in the same old lives
I feel too cold to live, too young to die
Won't you follow me into the jungle (yeah)

Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (oh lord child)

Won't you follow me into the jungle (yeah)

Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (oh lord child)

Won't you follow me into the jungle
Hold on, holy ghost

Go on, hold me close

Better run, here we come

It’s the day of the dead
Hold on, holy ghost (hold on)

Go on, hold me close (go on)

Better run, here we come

It’s the day of the dead

Hold on, holy ghost (hold on)

So long to the ones you know (so long)

Better run, here we come

It’s the day of the dead
This is the day of the dead, this ain't no day in the park

Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows
Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl
Back back way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg
Anchorage
Dar es Salaam
While home in New York was champagne and disco

Tapes from L.A. slash San Francisco

But actually Oakland and not Alameda

Your girl was in Berkeley with her Communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and walkman
I was a hoarder but girl that was back then
The gloves are off,
the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house

Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone
Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl
Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She's richer than Croesus
she's tougher than leather
I just ignore all the tales of her past life

Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh when they saw us together

Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather
I can still see them there huddled on Astor
the sound of the master
Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
Age is an honor - it's still not the truth
We saw the stars when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her
The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
the true way of all flesh
Everyone's dying, but girl - you're not old yet
We bitch and we fight

Diss each other on sight
But this thing we do
These times together

Rain or shine or stormy weather

This thing we do
With world-weary grace
We've taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name
Or stay home by the fire, filled by desire

Stoking the flame
But we’re here for the ride
It's louder than words

This thing that we do
Louder than words

The way it unfurls
It's louder than words

The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
The strings bend and slide

As the hours glide by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues

Gonna tap out the rhythm
Let's go with the flow, wherever it goes
We're more than alive
Louder than words

The way it unfurls
Is there with a pulse
It's strange; whenever I see a gun, I think about just how

Petty you are

And it blows my fucking mind - it blows my fucking mind

These days, I never seem to get enough, I'm tired of this

Shit - I want to go home

Don't waste my fucking time - don't waste my fucking

Time
Because anything exceptional gets crushed by common

People

With jealousy and ignorance and all their common evils
So cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

CUT/CUT/CUT ME UP AND FUCK/FUCK/FUCK ME UP
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

CUT/CUT/CUT ME UP AND FUCK/FUCK/FUCK ME UP
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

CUT/CUT/CUT ME UP AND FUCK/FUCK/FUCK ME UP
So I got edges that scratch

And sometimes I don't got a filter

But I'm so tired of eating all of my misspoken words
I know my disposition gets confusing

My disproportionate reactions fuse with my eager state

That’s why you wanna come out and play with me (yeah)

(Why, why, why)
Stooped down and out

You got me beggin’ for thread

To sew this hole up that you ripped in my head

Stupidly think you had it under control
Strapped down to something that you don't understand

Don't know what you were getting yourself into

You should have known

Secretly, I think you knew
I got some dirt on my shoes
My words can come out as a pistol

And I'm no good at aiming

But I can aim it at you

I like us better when we're wasted

It makes it easier to fake it
The only time we really talk

Is when our clothes are coming off
I like us better when we're wasted

It makes it easier to say it

Lay all your laundry on the bed

And then I'll lay it in instead

I like us better when we're wasted
She had a face straight out a magazine
Her balaclava is starting to chafe
Said one more line
Now everybody’s dead
All I am is a man

I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach

But I stand in California

With my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves on my sweater

Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love
two mouths
One love, one house

No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out

Nothing I really wanna tell you about, no
Cause it's too cold (whoa)

For you here

And now

So let me hold (whoa)

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say

Sometimes the silence guides your mind

To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to race
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watched your face

Put my finger on your tongue

Cause you love to taste yeah
These hearts adore

Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths

One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
I didn't want to be the one to forget

I thought of everything I'd never regret

A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
I don’t believe in him — his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the “Roche”

But no one gives us any time anymore
I got this picture of us kids in my head

And all I hear is the last thing that you said
'I listened to your problems

Now listen to mine'

I didn't want to anymore, oh oh ohh
And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Can I give it up or give it away
So I chained myself to a friend

Cause I know it unlocks like a door
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Gotta give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say

But I never really know where to go

So I chained myself to a friend
It didn't matter what they wanted to see

He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seam in the wall

He cannot break it down or else he would fall
1,000 lonely stars

Hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't wanna sing anymore
I don't understand, don't get upset I'm not with you...
We’re swimming around, it's all I do

When I'm with you
Call it magic, call it true

I call it magic when I'm with you

And I just got broken, broken into two

Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you
And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't

No I don't, it's true

I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't

Want anybody else but you
Call it magic, cut me into two

And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you

Still, I call it magic; such a precious jewel
Wanna fall, fall so far

I wanna fall, fall so hard

And I call it magic

And I call it true

I call it magic
And if you were to ask me

After all that we've been through

"Still believe in magic?"

Yes, I do

Yes, I do

Yes, I do

Yes, I do

Of course I do
Yo te miro y se me corta la respiración
Light reflects from your shadow

It is more than I thought could exist
You move through the room

Like breathing was easy
If someone believed me



They would be

As in love with you as I am

They would be

As in love with you as I am

They would be

As in love with you as I am

They would be

In love, love, love
And everyday

I am learning about you

The things that no one else sees
And the end comes too soon
Like dreaming of angels

And leaving without them

And leaving without them
And with words unspoken

A silent devotion
I know you know what I mean
And the end is unknown

But I think I’m ready

As long as you’re with me
The animals, the animals

Trapped, trapped, trapped 'til the cage is full

The cage is full
Stay awake

In the dark, count mistakes

The light was off but now it's on
Searching the ground for a bit of sun
The sun is out, the day is new
And everyone is waiting, waiting on you
And you've got time

And you've got time
Think of all the roads

Think of all their crossings
Taking steps is easy

Standing still is hard
Remember all their faces

Remember all their voices
Everything is different

The second time around
My girl's got a minimum
Keep it stuck right there 'til the lumber comes
smooth operator
Got the key to the kingdom
(And he thinks I'm the negative one)

Flag flappin' in Manhattan

New Dorp New York

Gargoyles gargling oil

Peak of the empire, top of the rock
My girl's got a little schtick

Keep your coat up in the kitchen while you feed the kids
you know where it’s done

(You think I’m the negative one)
black Israelites
White women
Dynalites
I got a baseball bat, never hit home runs
Feeling my way through the darkness

Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end

But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand

They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes

Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over

When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself

And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world

But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world

But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young

Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone

And love is a prize
I didn't know I was lost
She may contain the urge to run away

But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine your fever’s gripped me again
Never kisses all you ever send are fullstops
Do you know where the wilds things go

They go along to take your honey (la la la la)
Break down now weep build up breakfast now

Let’s eat my love my love love love
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go

My heart sinks as I jump up

Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
Do you know where the wilds things go

They go along to take your honey
She bruises coughs she splutters pistol shots
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She’s morphine queen of my vaccine
Germolene disinfect the scene my love my love love love
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole

I love you so
The mirror's image, tells me it's home time

But I'm not finished, cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming, of bumping into you
Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply
Why'd you only call me when you're high, high?

Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Somewhere darker, talking the same shite
I need a partner, well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen, more I get through the gears

Incapable of making alright decisions, and having bad ideas
And I can't see you here, wondering where I might
It sort of feels like I'm running out of time

I haven't found all I was hoping to find
You said you got to be up in the morning, going to have an early night
And you're starting to bore me, baby, why'd you only call me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Like the legend of the phoenix

All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning

The force from the beginning
We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars
She's up all night to the sun, I'm up all night to get some

She's up all night for good fun, I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun, we're up all night to get some

We're up all night for good fun, we're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
The present has no ribbon

Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?

If you want to leave, I'm with it
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
He won't make love to me now

Not now, I've set the fee

He said it's too much in pounds

I guess I'm stuck with me
He told me I was so small
I told him "Water me

I promise I can grow tall

When making love is free"
He won't make love to me now

Not now, I've set the fee

He said it's too much in pounds

I guess I'm stuck with me
He told me I was so small
I told him "Water me"
I want you by my side

So that I never feel alone again
They’ve always been so kind

But now they’ve brought you away from here

I hope they didn't get your mind

Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time

They have stolen from us
And I want you

We can bring it on the floor

You’ve never danced like this before

But we don’t talk about it

Dancin on doin the boogie all night long

Stoned in paradise

Shouldn’t talk about it

Shouldn't talk about it x2
Coldest winter for me

No sun is shining anymore

The only thing I feel is pain

Caused by absence of you
I want you by my side

So that i never feel alone again
Seid ihr das Essen?

Nein, wir sind der Jäger!
Fumareta hana no　Namae mo shirazu ni
Inotta tokoro de　Nani mo kawaranai
Shikabane fumikoete　Susumu ishi wo　Warau buta yo
Kachiku no annei　...Kyogi no han'ei
　...Shiseru garou "Jiyuu" wo!

I'm wakin' up to ash and dust

I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust

I'm breathin' in the chemicals

I'm breakin' in, shapin' up

Then checkin' out on the prison bus

This is it, the apocalypse, whoa



I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones

Enough to make my systems blow

Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive



I raise my flags, dye my clothes

It's a revolution, I suppose

We'll paint it red to fit right in

Whoa

I'm breakin' in, shapin' up

Checkin' out on the prison bus

This is it, the apocalypse

Whoa





All systems go, sun hasn't died

Deep in my bones, straight from inside
Bury me alive,
bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds

Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Fuck, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't give a fuck and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies,
all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, fuck your amenities, I'm gettin' better with time
AHHHHH!
When the days are cold
and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail

Are the worst of all
and the blood’s run stale
I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, There’s nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat,
look into my eyes

It’s where my demons hide, it’s where my demons hide

Don’t get too close, it’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide, it’s where my demons hide
At the curtain’s call is the last of all

When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade

Will come calling out at the mess you made
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate

It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save their light

I can't escape this now, unless you show me how
You bite your friends like like chocolate
You say, we go where nobody knows
Got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gunna' quit it

No we're never gunna' quit it, no
Now we run run away from the boys in the blue

And my car smells like chocolate
Hey now think about what to do

Think about what to say, I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it play it, pause it
Oh we go where nobody knows
No we're never gunna' quit it

No we're never gunna' quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gunna' quit it. no we're never gunna' quit it no
Now you're never gunna' quit it

Now you're never gunna' quit it
Now you're never gunna' quit it

If you don't stop smoking it
That's what she said
Hey now we're building up speed as we're approaching the hill
Oh my hair smells like chocolate
Hey now you say you're gunna' quit it

But you're never gunna' quit it
Go get it, go get it

Got get it, go get it, go!

And play it cool
Well I think we better go, seriously better go

Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go

Oh oh, well I think we better go

Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go
Bite your face to spite your nose
17 and a half years old
I'm worrying about my brother finding out

Where’s the fun in doing what you're told?
I said "No!"
'Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you

I'm not your typical,
stoned 18 year old
Give me a night I'll make you
"I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age, but girl I'm not your savior"
Wrestle to the ground

God help me now
They're just girls breaking hearts

Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls

They're just girls
A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse

Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?
I said "Yo, I think you better go, cause I can't take you
You just sit and get stoned with 30-year-olds and you think you've made it"
'Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?'
I told her from the start

Destined to be hard

I told her from the start

I’ll break your heart

Destined to be hard

Break your heart
I said "Yo, I think you better go, cause I can't take you"

I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age, but girl I'm not your savior"

'Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?'

Wrestle to the ground

God help me now because
Because they're just girls...
I feel the water flow as I watch him go
Boy life is cynical despite my heart of gold
Oh no, buddy don't you cry as they go

Life changes all of us, it's not your fault, no no no
Oh oh oh

Where did they all run to?
Oh oh oh

Where the sky is blue forever

Oh oh oh

Where the sky is blue forever
Love is a dangerous business you know

Who's gonna care for your bleeding soul?
Take a run, take a run with me
Where the sky is blue forever
Till the end of time
And dear buddy don't you cry when she goes

Cause life is cynical despite your heart of gold
Life makes us critical and all, we gotta change the course
Take a run, we can all be free

Where the sky is blue forever
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed

With a word she can get what she came for

Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure

Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings

Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Ooh, it makes me wonder

Ooh, it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west

And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees

And the voices of those who stand looking
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune

Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now

It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run

There's still time to change the road you're on
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady,
can you hear the wind blow
and did you know

Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know

Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold

And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
