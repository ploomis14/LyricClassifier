[Verse 2 Chris Brown]

Lil nigga bigger than gorilla

'Cause I'm killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit

Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her

And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick

Oops I said on my dick

I ain't really mean to say on my dick

But since we're talking about my dick

All of you haters say hi to it

I'm done
[Verse 3 Busta Rhymes]

Ayo breezy

Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling

When your doing that thang over there homie

Let's go!

'Cause I feel like I'm running

And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away

Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop

'cause you know I gotta win everyday day [go!]

See they don't really wanna pop me

Just know that you will never flop me

And I know that I can be a little cocky

You ain't never gonna stop me

Every time I come a nigga gotta set it, then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it

Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta shred it.....

any little thing that nigga think he be doing

'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna dadadada

Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing

I gotta do a lot of things, to make it clearer to a couple niggas

That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and again

And I be doing it to death and now I move a little foul

A nigga better call a ref, and everybody knows my style

And niggas know I'm the the best when it come to doing this

And I be banging on my chest, and I bang in the east, and I'm banging in the west

And I come to give you more and I will never give you less

You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press

Do you really wanna know what's next? Let's go

See the way we on and we all up in the race and you know

We gotta go, and try to keep up with the pace

We struggling and hustling and sending it and getting it

And always gotta do it take it to another place

Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it

And I gotta cut all through this traffic

Just to be at the top of the throne

Better know I gotta have it, have it
[Chorus Chris Brown]

Look at me now, look at me now

Oh, I'm getting paper

Look at me now

Oh, look at me now

Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker

Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y'all doin'?

I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no I'm pollution, no substitution

Got a bitch that play in movies in my Jacuzzi, pussy juicy

I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar

Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with an elevator

You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter

Marley said, "Shoot 'em," and I said, "OK"

If you want that bullshit then I'm like "OlÃ©"

I don't care what you say, so don't even speak

Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil

That's word to my flag, and my flag red

I'm out of my head, bitch I'm outta my mind, from the bottom I climb

You ain't hotter than mine, nope, not on my time and I'm not even trying

What's poppin' Slime? Nothin' five, and if they trippin' fuck 'em five

I ain't got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie

Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight,

Bitch I've been tight since "Guiding light",

And my pockets right, and my diamonds white

And my momma's nice and my daddy's dead

You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild, been here for a while

I was like fuck trial I puts it down

I'm so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now, bitch

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

Look at me now, look at me now

Oh, I'm getting paper

Look at me now

Oh, look at me now

Yeah, I'm fresher than a motherfucker

[Outro: Chris Brown]

Okay, okay

Is that right?

I'm fresher than a motherfucker
I remember when,

I remember, I remember when I lost my mind

There was something so special about that place

Even your emotions have an echo in so much space
And when you're out there without care

Yeah, I was out of touch

But it wasn't because I didn't know enough

I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?

Does that make me crazy?

Does that make me crazy?

Possibly
And I hope that you are

Having the time of your life

But think twice

That's my only advice
Come on now, who do you

Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?

Ha ha ha, bless your soul

You really think you're in control?
Well, I think you're crazy

I think you're crazy

I think you're crazy

Just like me
My heroes had the heart

To live their lives out on a limb

And all I remember

Is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little

Ever since I was little

It looked like fun

And it's no coincidence I've come

And I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm crazy

Maybe you're crazy

Maybe we're crazy

Probably

ouh ouh crazy
Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings

But I'm only going to get this one chance

Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)

Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what

If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,

And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances

You were just what the doctor ordered
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?

They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes

I got a laptop in my back pocket

My pen'll go off when I half-cock it

Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it

Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office

With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack

I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)

This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop

You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap

Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac

The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing

That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table

Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact

How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack

Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad

It's actually disastrously bad

For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?

Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance

Everybody loves to root for a nuisance

Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since

MC's get taken to school with this music

Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme

Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-

-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position

To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'

Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames

Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

On the wall of shame

You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames

Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?

Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy

You witnessing a massacre

Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy

Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy

You get a thumbs up, pat on the back

And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy

Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?

I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy

I'mma work for everything I have

Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy

Basically boy you're never gonna be capable

To keep up with the same pace looking boy
'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar

Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God

Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent

Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'

And I should not be woken

I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating

But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle

I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil

It's me, my honesty's brutal

But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while

So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle

Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times

But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned

Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime

I know there was a time where once I

Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine

Appeal with the skin color of mine

You get too big and here they come trying to,

Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Marshall Mathers LP

One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine

Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine

See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've

Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal

You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though

And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for

You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows

You're like normal, fuck being normal

And I just bought a new Raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad

'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad

Singin' to a man while they played piano

Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel

So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day

"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"

Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human

What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman

Innovative and I'm made of rubber

So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you

I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating

How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating

Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting

For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating

Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated

I make elevating music, you make elevator music

Oh, he's too mainstream

Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it

It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it

With rock, shock rap with Doc

Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that

I don't know what words to use

Let me know when it occurs to you

While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you

It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you

How many verses I gotta murder to,

Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!

School flunkie, pill junky

But look at the accolades the skills brung me

Full of myself, but still hungry

I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to

And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues

But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you

I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat

Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky

But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling

Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate

But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had

Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation

And understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then

But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?

Don't mistake it for Satan

It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas

And take a vacation to trip a broad

And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard

Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?
Look, if you had, one shot, or one opportunity

To seize everything you ever wanted, one moment

Would you capture it?

Or just let it slip, yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti

He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready

To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud

He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now

The clock's run out, times up, over, blaoh!

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity

Oh, there goes Rabbit He choked, he's so mad but he won't

Give up that easy, no, he won't have it he knows

His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he so stagnant he knows

When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's

Back to the lab again, yo

This whole rhapsody better go capture this moment

And hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music

The moment, you own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better lose yourself in the music

The moment, you own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping

This world is mine for the taking, make me king

As we move toward a new world order, a normal life is boring

But superstardom's close to post mortem

It only grows harder, homie grows hotter

He blows. It's all over, these hoes is all on him

Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter lonely roads

God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father

He goes home and barely knows his own daughter

But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water

These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows

He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera is told it unfolds

I suppose it's all over, but the beat goes on

Da da dum, da dum da da da
You better lose yourself in the music

The moment, you own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better lose yourself in the music

The moment, you own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage

Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged

I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed

I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhyming and stepped, writing the next cypher

Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper

All the pain inside amplified by the fact

That I can't get by with my 9 to 5

And I can't provide the right type of life for my family

Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers

And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder

Trying to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter

Caught up between being a father and a prima donna

Baby mama drama's screaming on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's

Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail

I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot

Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not

Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go

I cannot grow old in 'Salem's lot, so here I go it's my shot

Feet fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music

The moment, you own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better lose yourself in the music

The moment, you own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
All the time I have laidÂ in your love

When your love kept me safe through the night

All the time I was sure you were mine

And before time demands our goodbye

Can you sing me a last lullaby?
It's been a while since I last dreamt

Barely remember what it's like to dream

Finding it hard to get to sleep, too stressed

And there ain't anyone to sing a lullaby to me

Pretend shit doesn't get to me

And I suffer in silence when I'm hurting

A man's problems are his own

And it's my burden

Tossing and turning, trying to get to sleep

But I find it hard to switch off when my mind's working

I ponder on things I shouldn't ponder on

Off the rails, my train of thought's wandering

Sick of pretending to be so happy

All the while my anxiety's away at me

My skin crawling, I look up to the sky

And it falls, the walls close in and it's

As if all the good in my life disappears

In an instant, that thing is just so distant

So seeing the ones who I love, the ones who love me

But I don't wanna tell em how I feel in case they judge me

It's just me, wish I could let somebody in

But I ain't ever been too trusting
All the time I have laidÂ in your love

When your love kept me safe through the night

All the time I was sure you were mine

And before time demands our goodbye

Can you sing me a last lullaby?
I've barely had any sleep when I get up

Sick of all these nightmares and these night terrors

Like it's only when I'm in heaven that I sleep better

Might sleep better when I get up, I'm weak

It just makes my day harder, I wonder if

It would've been any different if I had a father that I knew

Could it have helped shape the way that I grew?

But the point of things I never have went from

Being a reason for the things that I do

To just being an excuse that I'd use

I've gotta take responsibility for the things I do

Find something other than negativity for my fuel

But I feed off it, even when I don't seem bothered

I hide everything that's going on inside

Guess it's been a while since I've been honest, I need help

But I deny it and even lie to myself like I'm fine
All the time I have laid in your love

When your love kept me safe through the night

All the time I was sure you were mine

And before time demands our goodbye

Can you sing me a last lullaby?
I just wish someone would tell me it would be OK

But pessimism leads me to believe that it won't

To see even a glimmer of hope in the darkness

Is hard and depression is a slippery slope

I don't wanna do what my dad did with a rope, though

So I carry on even though it's hard to

The only thing that's definite is death and things always change

As long as you give em a chance to
All the time I have laidÂ in your love

When your love kept me safe through the night

All the time I was sure you were mine

And before time demands our goodbye

Can you sing me a last lullaby?
(Can you sing me a last lullaby?)
All the time I have laid in your love

When your love kept me safe through the night

All the time I was sure you were mine

And before time demands our goodbye

Where you sing me a last lullaby?

Hundred, fifty, twenties, all I see is paper

Smokin' on Jamaica

You get wrong you meet ya maker

Poppin' bottles, shout out to my haters

You my motivator, that's why we be motivated

All this gwualla, all black them Raitors

Running in yo' shit

We ain't gone quit, until we take 'em

(aye aye aye)

Only if you know

Broke no joke (joke)

Coming from the ghetto

Not no mo' (mo')

Always on go mode

Tic tac toe (aye)

Light it up yo' ho
Late night candy creepin'

With yo' demo lick

Servin' swervin' on the highway

And I'm doing bout 80

I can see them haters talkin'

But it do not phase me

I done got it out them boys

That's that shit that made me

That's that shit that made me

That's that shit that made me

I done got it out them boys

That's that shit that made me

That's that shit that made me

That's that shit that made me

I done got it off them boys

That's that shit that made me

(Aye aye aye)

QuiÃ©n puede domar la fuerza del mar

Que se mete por tus venas

Lo caliente del sol que se te metiÃ³

Y no te deja quieta nena

QuiÃ©n puede parar eso que al bailar

Descontrola tus caderas, sexy

Y ese fuego que quema por dentro

Y lento te convierte en fiera

Con las manos arriba

Cintura sola

Da media vuelta

Y sacude duro

No te quites ahora

Que esto solo empieza

Mueve la cabeza

Bustin' out the bando

A nigga jewelry real metal like a can opener

I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip

I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips

And the F&N make my hip limp

I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dips

And my bank roll got a big dip

She gon' bring it on a big ship

Quite trill, no Quik Trip

I got drugs in the alley, no tip there

She just wanna have a good day

Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A

I want them birds 'til next May

Never let em fly away

What!? I heard ay

Listen what my nigga Tip say
If it ain't about the money

Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up

If it ain't about the money

Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time

If it ain't about the money

Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit

If it ain't about the money

Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it
I'm packin' 11, I'm packin' 11

I ride in a gator, my shoes are Guiseppe

I'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend

Pants out the grocery store, they stuck with lettuce

She try make the extras, I told on these bitches

When it's bout time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches
Ay what you think we in the neighborhood for?

Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough

I'll be damned if a nigga wipe a hood hoe

Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones"

Put your money down I could book a hard four

You playin' with it, I'ma send 'em through your car door

But while I flood the shit sick got prob' oh

I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo

The head honcho, nigga no Tonto, nigga

I'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga

Niggas talk shit, well I don't respond to no nigga

No murder, no dough, no convo
If it ain't about the money

Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up

If it ain't about the money

Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time

If it ain't about the money

Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit

If it ain't about the money

Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it
I'm packin' 11, I'm packin' 11

I ride in a gator, my shoes are Guiseppe

I'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend

Pants out the grocery store, they stuck with lettuce

She try make the extras, I told on these bitches

When it's bout time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches
Aye, what you think we in the neighborhood for?

Standin in the trap, slangin good blow

Maybach used to slang that crack

Buy a stolen car while he bang that AK

If you ever took a loss better bring that back

Catcha' witcha' betcha' heat will blow your brains bout that

Know you better be, on your best behavior when addressing me

Because, bye-gones, we don't let em be

Niggas disrespect me, I'm a catch a felony

For real, if you listen I can get you paid

But not interested in shit you say
If it ain't about the money

Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up

If it ain't about the money

Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time

If it ain't about the money

Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit

If it ain't about the money

Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it
I'm packin' 11, I'm packin' 11

I ride in a gator, my shoes are Guiseppe

I'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend

Pants out the grocery store, they stuck with lettuce

She try make the extras, I told on these bitches

When it's bout time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches
Ay, what you think we in the neighborhood for?

Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough

I'll be damned if a nigga wife a hood ho

Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones" nigga
