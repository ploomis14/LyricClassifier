Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought

Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love’s a game, want to play?
New money, suit & tie

I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly

And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand

I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever

Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over

If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless

We'll take this way too far

It'll leave you breathless

Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby

And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies

I could show you incredible things

Stolen kisses, pretty lies

You're the King baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want

Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storm

I can make all the tables turn

Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like

"Oh my God, who is she?"

I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave

Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
Boys only want love if it's torture

Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real

Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag,
and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

(Look at her butt)

Look at, look at, look at

Look, at her butt
This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles

Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag,
Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...
Little in the middle but she got much back

Little in the middle but she got much back

Little in the middle but she got much back
(Oh my God, look at her butt)
Yeah, he love this fat ass, hahahahahahahaha!
Yeah! This one is for my bitches with a fat ass in the fucking club

I said, where my fat ass big bitches in the club?
Fuck the skinny bitches

Fuck the skinny bitches in the club

I wanna see all the big fat-ass bitches in the muthafuckin' club

Fuck you if you skinny bitches, what?!
Kyuh
Hahahaha
RRRRRR
Yeah, I got a big fat ass (ass, ass, ass...)
Come on!
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes

They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe

You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat

Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it

You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'

Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating

Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along

I'mma ask on the song
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace

But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend

What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em

If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?

I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me

I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't 
, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along

I'mma ask on the song
So, does she know I've been in that bed before?

A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl

Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself
Dum-da-de-da

Do, do, do, do, do, do

(Coming down, dripping candy on the groun')
It's that Yoncé, your Yoncé

In that lingerie, on that chardonnay

Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever like Bun B
And I'm Redboned yo
I'm really rit like Donjae

I'm camo in here yo
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake

Boy, you know I look good as fuck

Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no

We escalating, up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down

When it's a billion dollars on an elevator

Of course sometimes shit go down

When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

You wake up, flawless

Post up, flawless

Ridin' round in it, flawless

Flossin' on that, flawless

This diamond, flawless

My diamond, flawless

This rock, flawless

God damn, God damn, God damn

And I wouldn’t change it if I could

(If I could, if I, if I, could)
And you can say what you want, I’m the shit

(What you want I’m the shit, I'm the shit)

(I’m the shit, I’m the shit, I’m the shit)
I want everyone to feel like this tonight

God damn, God damn, God damn!
(Onika...)
Looking Trinidadian, Japanese and Indian
Got Malaysian, got that yaki, that wavy Brazilian
(Them bitches thirsty, I’m Hungarian)
(Nicki, BB, be eating, diamond fangs, barbarian, ah)
Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me

Propofol, I know they hope I fall
But tell ‘em winning is my motherfuckin’ protocol
‘Cause I score before I ever throw the ball
These bitches washed up and ain’t no fuckin’ soap involved, uh
This every hood nigga dream, fantasizing about Nicki and Bey

Curvalicious, pussy served delicious
Mayday, mayday, earth to bitches
Slap these hoes on they ass, like we birthing bitches, UHN!
The queen of rap, slayin' with Queen B
If you ain’t on the team, you playin’ for team D

Cause we A-listers, we paid sisters
This watch right here done phased blizzards
I confess, I woke up like this
All this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick
Instagram, another flawless pic
Flawless city with these flawless titties
I got all these hundreds, you got all them fifties

I’m with some flawless bitches because they more than pretty
Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back, I be on my frisbee
Princess cut diamonds on my Disney
He want monster Nicki in Sri Lanka
I told him meet me at the Trump, Ivanka
I said come here, let me show you how this cookie taste

This that "Yeah, nigga, eat the cookie" face
(Right, right, right)
Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights

Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a  while since I have even heard from you
I should just tell you to leave cause I know exactly where it leads

But I watch it go round and round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down, we come back every time

Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl"

He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I."
I said "I've been there, too, a few times
Take me home

Just take me home

Just take me home
Because you know I'm all about that bass

'bout that bass, no treble

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two

But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase, and

All the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop

We know that shit ain't real

Come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up

Cause every inch of you is perfect

From the bottom to the top
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size

She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night (that booty, booty, uh, that booty booty
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll

So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along
Hey, I'm bringing booty back

Maman dit que lorsqu'on cherche bien

Qu'il part très souvent travailler

Bien mieux qu'être mal accompagné
Pas vrai ?
Où est ton papa ?

Dis-moi où est ton papa ?
Sans même devoir lui parler

Il sait ce qui ne va pas

Ah sacré papa
Dis-moi où es-tu caché ?

Ça doit, faire au moins mille fois que j'ai

Compté mes doigts
Où t'es, papaoutai ?

Où t'es, papaoutai ?

Où t'es, papaoutai ?

Où t'es, où t'es où, papaoutai ?
Serons-nous détestables ?

Serons-nous admirables ?

Des géniteurs ou des génies ?
Dites-nous qui donne naissance aux irresponsables ?
Tout le monde sait comment on fait les bébés

Mais personne sait comment on fait des papas
Monsieur Je-sais-tout en aurait hérité, c'est ça
Faut l'sucer d'son pouce ou quoi ?
Dites-nous où c'est caché, ça doit

Faire au moins mille fois qu'on a, bouffé nos doigts

I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs

Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless

Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies

Throw up in the tub and I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, tastin' kind of lonely
You're gone and I got to stay

High, all the time, to keep you off my mind

High, all the time, to keep you off my mind
Spend my days locked in a haze

Tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down

Gotta stay high, all my life

To forget I'm missin' you
Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my day time

Loosen up their frown, make 'em feel alive

Make it fast and greasy, I'm numb and way too easy
Stayin' in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again need someone to numb the pain
I know it hurts

You know I’d quench that thirst

(I can treat you better than her)

You say you're lonely
I say you'll think about it
Cause you're the only

One who resonates that chaste, mouth open like ahh
Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover
Flying like a streamer thinking of new ways to do each other
Pull out of the incisor give me two weeks, you won’t recognize her
Mouth open you're high
I know it hurts

You know I'd put you first

(I can fuck you better than her)
You say you want me

I say you'll live without it
Unless you're the only

One who instigates, get your mouth open you're high
Feel your body closing, I can rip it open

Suck me up, I'm healing for the shit you're dealing

Smoke on your skin to get those pretty eyes rolling
My thighs are apart for when you’re ready to breathe in
Suck me up, I'm healing with all the shit you're dealing

Motherfucker, get your mouth open you know you’re mine
I’d put you first, just close your eyes and dream about it

Higher than a motherfucker dreaming of you as my lover

I’ll quench your thirst, just chase the high and stop your doubting
High motherfucker, get your mouth open you know you’re mine
When I was on, when I was on stage

And I was thinking of..

I felt like I know

I know him though

And I know that, and I know his heart

And I know what he wouldn't do to hurt me
But I didn't realize that I-I-I

Feeling so confident, feeling so great about myself

And then it just be completely shattered

By one thing, by something so stupid
But then you make me feel crazy

You make me feel like it's my fault

I was in pain
You got me sipping on something

I can't compare to nothing

I've ever known,
I'm hoping

That after this fever I'll survive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here

The future that we hold is so unclear

But I'm not alive until you call

And I'll bet the odds against it all
But the heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts

The heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait

And every second's like torture
Finding a way to let go

Baby, baby, no I can't escape
But the heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts

The heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts

The heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts

The heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts
This is a modern

Fairytale

No happy ending
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine

A life without

Breathless moments

Breaking me down, down, down, down
It wants what it wants

It wants what it wants
Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I’ll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment I bite my lip

Baby in that moment you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss

Give me a reason to believe it
Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

Love me, love me, love me, harder, harder
I know your motives and you know mine

The ones that love me I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip

When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?

I'll make it feel like the first time
Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh love me, love me, love me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh harder, harder, harder, harder

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh love me, love me, love me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh harder, harder, harder, harder
So what do I do if I can’t figure it out?

(You got to try, try, try again, yeah)

So what do I do if I can’t figure it out?

(I’m gonna leave, leave, leave again)
Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh love me, love me, love me (love you)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh harder, harder, harder, harder

Love me, love me, love me just a little bit harder

It ain't karaoke night but get the mic ‘cause I'm singing
(Uh, B to the A to the N to the G to the uh)

(B to the A to the N to the G to the hey)

See, anybody could be good to you

You need a bad girl to blow your mind
Yeah, I said bang, bang

Bang, bang, bang, bang
I met this girl late last year

She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake"

I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned

I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights

Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again

She told me
"I was never looking for a friend

Maybe you could swing by my room around ten

Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin

We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold

All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her

We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her

Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature

And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way

Four cities, two planes, the same day

And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out

I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch

But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door

I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya

Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all

And I never saw him as a threat

Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour

We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment

But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest

And all this time, God knows I'm singing
He said, "Let's get out of this town

Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"

I thought, heaven can't help me now

Nothing lasts forever

But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell

He's so bad, but he does it so well

I can see the end as it begins

My one condition is
Say you'll remember me

Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your

Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha

Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever

But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell

He's so bad, but he does it so well

And when we've had our very last kiss

My last request is
You see me in hindsight

Tangled up with you all night

Burning it down

Someday when you leave me

I bet these memories

Follow you around
Say you'll remember me

Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in pretend
Froo-oo-oo-oot lalalalalala

Ju-u-u-uice lalalalalala
I've seen seasons come and go

From winter sun to summer snow

This ain't my first time at the rodeo
Nature ain't a fruit machine

She's gotta keep her credits clean
Good things come to those who wait

But I ain't in a patient phase
It's summer time and I hang on a vine

They're gonna make me into sweet red wine

Hanging around like a fruit on a tree

Waiting to be picked, come on cut me free
Come on fill your cup up

Looking for some good luck

Good luck, good luck to you
Hanging like a fruit

Ready to be juiced

Juiced, juiced
Living la dolce vita

Life couldn't get much sweeter
Don't you give me a reason

That it's not the right season

Babe, I love you a lot

I'll give you all I've got

Yeah, you know that it's true
I've been saving all my summers for you

I've been saving all my summers for you
Like froot, like froot
Baby, I am plump and ripe
I'm pinker than shepherd's delight
Sweet like honeysuckle late at night
Leave it too long I'll go rot

Like an apple you forgot

Birds and worms will come for me

The cycle of life is complete
I'm your carnal flower, I'm your bloody rose
Pick my petals off and make my heart explode
I'm your deadly nightshade, I'm your cherry tree
Come on fill your cup up

Looking for some good luck

Good luck, good luck to you
Autumn, I'll be gone

Birds will sing their mourning song

Song
Oh my body is ready
Yeah it's ready, yeah it's ready for your love

Oh my branches are heavy

Yeah they're heavy, yeah they're heavy
Living la dolce vita

I'm in love

Living la dolce vita

I'm in love

I'm in love
Part 1: "Yoncé"
Let me hear you say "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)

Say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls

Posted in the back,

Brooklyn brim

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, puffing on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
Cuz when he wanna smash I'll just write another one

Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up

He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse

He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown
Oh there daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel

Driver, roll up the partition fast

Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting

He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we’ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping trying not to crash
Oh there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur

Oh baby baby be sweating out my hair
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up

We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?

Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça?

Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?

Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought

Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love’s a game, want to play?
New money, suit & tie

I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly

And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand

I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever

Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over

If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless

We'll take this way too far

It'll leave you breathless

Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby

And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies

I could show you incredible things

Stolen kisses, pretty lies

You're the King baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want

Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storm

I can make all the tables turn

Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like

"Oh my God, who is she?"

I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave

Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
Boys only want love if it's torture

Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real

Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag,
and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

(Look at her butt)

Look at, look at, look at

Look, at her butt
This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles

Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag,
Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...
Little in the middle but she got much back

RRRRRR
Yeah, I got a big fat ass (ass, ass, ass...)
Come on!
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes

They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe

You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat

Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it

You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'

Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating

Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along

I'mma ask on the song
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace

But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend

What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em

If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?

I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me

I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't 
, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along

I'mma ask on the song
So, does she know I've been in that bed before?

A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl

Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself
Dum-da-de-da

Do, do, do, do, do, do

(Coming down, dripping candy on the groun')
It's that Yoncé, your Yoncé

In that lingerie, on that chardonnay

Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever like Bun B
And I'm Redboned yo
I'm really rit like Donjae

I'm camo in here yo
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake

Boy, you know I look good as fuck

Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no

We escalating, up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down

When it's a billion dollars on an elevator

Of course sometimes shit go down

When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

Ridin' round in it, flawless

And you can say what you want, I’m the shit

(What you want I’m the shit, I'm the shit)

(I’m the shit, I’m the shit, I’m the shit)
I want everyone to feel like this tonight

God damn, God damn, God damn!
(Onika...)
Looking Trinidadian, Japanese and Indian
Got Malaysian, got that yaki, that wavy Brazilian
(Them bitches thirsty, I’m Hungarian)
(Nicki, BB, be eating, diamond fangs, barbarian, ah)
Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me

Propofol, I know they hope I fall
But tell ‘em winning is my motherfuckin’ protocol
‘Cause I score before I ever throw the ball
These bitches washed up and ain’t no fuckin’ soap involved, uh
This every hood nigga dream, fantasizing about Nicki and Bey

Curvalicious, pussy served delicious
Mayday, mayday, earth to bitches
Slap these hoes on they ass, like we birthing bitches, UHN!
The queen of rap, slayin' with Queen B
If you ain’t on the team, you playin’ for team D

Cause we A-listers, we paid sisters
This watch right here done phased blizzards
I confess, I woke up like this
All this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick

Flawless city with these flawless titties

I’m with some flawless bitches because they more than pretty
Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back, I be on my frisbee
Princess cut diamonds on my Disney
He want monster Nicki in Sri Lanka
I told him meet me at the Trump, Ivanka
I said come here, let me show you how this cookie taste

This that "Yeah, nigga, eat the cookie" face
(Right, right, right)
Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights

Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a  while since I have even heard from you
I should just tell you to leave cause I know exactly where it leads

But I watch it go round and round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down, we come back every time

Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl"

He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I."
I said "I've been there, too, a few times
Take me home

Just take me home

Just take me home
Because you know I'm all about that bass

'bout that bass, no treble

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two

But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase, and

All the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop

We know that shit ain't real

Come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up

Cause every inch of you is perfect

From the bottom to the top
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size

She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night (that booty, booty, uh, that booty booty
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll

So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along
Hey, I'm bringing booty back

Maman dit que lorsqu'on cherche bien

On finit toujours par trouver
Elle dit qu'il n'est jamais très loin

Bien mieux qu'être mal accompagné
Pas vrai ?
Où est ton papa ?

Dis-moi où est ton papa ?
Sans même devoir lui parler

Il sait ce qui ne va pas

Ah sacré papa
Dis-moi où es-tu caché ?

Ça doit, faire au moins mille fois que j'ai

Compté mes doigts
Où t'es, papaoutai ?

Où t'es, papaoutai ?

Où t'es, papaoutai ?

Où t'es, où t'es où, papaoutai ?
Serons-nous détestables ?

Serons-nous admirables ?

Des géniteurs ou des génies ?
Dites-nous qui donne naissance aux irresponsables ?
Tout le monde sait comment on fait les bébés

Mais personne sait comment on fait des papas
Monsieur Je-sais-tout en aurait hérité, c'est ça
Faut l'sucer d'son pouce ou quoi ?
Dites-nous où c'est caché, ça doit

Faire au moins mille fois qu'on a, bouffé nos doigts

I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs

Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless

Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies

Throw up in the tub and I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, tastin' kind of lonely
You're gone and I got to stay

High, all the time, to keep you off my mind

High, all the time, to keep you off my mind
Spend my days locked in a haze

Tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down

Gotta stay high, all my life

To forget I'm missin' you
Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my day time

Loosen up their frown, make 'em feel alive

Make it fast and greasy, I'm numb and way too easy
Stayin' in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again need someone to numb the pain
I know it hurts

You know I’d quench that thirst

(I can treat you better than her)

You say you're lonely
I say you'll think about it
Cause you're the only

One who resonates that chaste, mouth open like ahh
Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover
Flying like a streamer thinking of new ways to do each other
Pull out of the incisor give me two weeks, you won’t recognize her
Mouth open you're high
I know it hurts

You know I'd put you first

(I can fuck you better than her)
You say you want me

I say you'll live without it
Unless you're the only

One who instigates, get your mouth open you're high
Feel your body closing, I can rip it open

Suck me up, I'm healing for the shit you're dealing

Smoke on your skin to get those pretty eyes rolling
My thighs are apart for when you’re ready to breathe in
Suck me up, I'm healing with all the shit you're dealing

Motherfucker, get your mouth open you know you’re mine
I’d put you first, just close your eyes and dream about it

Higher than a motherfucker dreaming of you as my lover

I’ll quench your thirst, just chase the high and stop your doubting
High motherfucker, get your mouth open you know you’re mine
When I was on, when I was on stage

And I was thinking of..

I felt like I know

I know him though

And I know that, and I know his heart

And I know what he wouldn't do to hurt me
But I didn't realize that I-I-I

Feeling so confident, feeling so great about myself

And then it just be completely shattered

By one thing, by something so stupid
But then you make me feel crazy

You make me feel like it's my fault

I was in pain
You got me sipping on something

I can't compare to nothing

I've ever known,
I'm hoping

That after this fever I'll survive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here

The future that we hold is so unclear

But I'm not alive until you call

And I'll bet the odds against it all
But the heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts

The heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait

And every second's like torture
Finding a way to let go

Baby, baby, no I can't escape
But the heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts

The heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts

The heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts

The heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts
This is a modern

Fairytale

No happy ending
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine

A life without

Breathless moments

Breaking me down, down, down, down
It wants what it wants

It wants what it wants
Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I’ll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment I bite my lip

Baby in that moment you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss

Give me a reason to believe it
Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

Love me, love me, love me, harder, harder
I know your motives and you know mine

The ones that love me I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip

When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?

I'll make it feel like the first time
Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh love me, love me, love me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh harder, harder, harder, harder

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh love me, love me, love me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh harder, harder, harder, harder
So what do I do if I can’t figure it out?

(You got to try, try, try again, yeah)

So what do I do if I can’t figure it out?

(I’m gonna leave, leave, leave again)
Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh love me, love me, love me (love you)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh harder, harder, harder, harder

Love me, love me, love me just a little bit harder

Cuz Sally's mad at Iggy because  Iggy's booty's more biggy


It’s Mir.I.Am and you know who
Ew! 
 ew! 

Ew! 
 ew! 
Hello my name is Sara, that's Sara with no "H"
My Stepdad Gary, he tries to act so cool

Every time we see him, my friends and I say "Ew!"
Hey funky bunch, what're you guys doing?



I heard that funky beat that you was playing down here

It's a party over here, it's a party over here


She got a body like an hourglass

But I can give it to you all the time
She got a booty like a Cadillac

But I can send you into overdrive
(You've been waiting for that, step on up, swing your bat)
See, anybody could be bad to you

You need a good girl to blow your mind, yeah
Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)

Bang bang all over you (I’ll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ahhh, hey!)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I’ll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ahhh, hey!)
She might've let you hold her hand in school

But I'mma show you how to graduate
No, I don't need to hear you talk the talk

Just come and show me what your momma gave, oh yeah
(I heard you've got a very big shhh, mouth but don’t say a thing)
See anybody could be good to you

You need a bad girl to blow your mind
You know what, girls?

Let me show you how to do it
It’s Myx moscato, it’s frizz in a bottle
It’s Nicki full throttle,
it’s oh, oh
Swimming in The Grotto
we winning in the lotto
We dipping in the powder blue, four door
Kitten so good, it's dripping on wood

Get a ride in the engine that could go
Batman, robbin' it,
bang bang, cockin' it
Queen Nicki dominant, prominent
It's me, Jessie, and Ari, if they test me, they sorry
Ride his uh like a Harley
then pull off in his Ferrari
If he hanging we banging, phone ranging, he slanging

It ain't karaoke night but get the mic ‘cause I'm singing
(Uh, B to the A to the N to the G to the uh)

(B to the A to the N to the G to the hey)

See, anybody could be good to you

You need a bad girl to blow your mind
Yeah, I said bang, bang

Bang, bang, bang, bang
I met this girl late last year

She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake"

I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned

I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights

Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again

She told me
"I was never looking for a friend

Maybe you could swing by my room around ten

Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin

We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold

All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her

We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her

Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature

And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way

Four cities, two planes, the same day

And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out

I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch

But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door

I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya

Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all

And I never saw him as a threat

Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour

We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment

But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest

And all this time, God knows I'm singing
He said, "Let's get out of this town

Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"

I thought, heaven can't help me now

Nothing lasts forever

But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell

He's so bad, but he does it so well

I can see the end as it begins

My one condition is
Say you'll remember me

Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your

Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha

Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever

But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell

He's so bad, but he does it so well

And when we've had our very last kiss

My last request is
You see me in hindsight

Tangled up with you all night

Burning it down

Someday when you leave me

I bet these memories

Follow you around
Say you'll remember me

Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in pretend
Froo-oo-oo-oot lalalalalala

Ju-u-u-uice lalalalalala
I've seen seasons come and go

From winter sun to summer snow

This ain't my first time at the rodeo
Nature ain't a fruit machine

She's gotta keep her credits clean
Good things come to those who wait

But I ain't in a patient phase
It's summer time and I hang on a vine

They're gonna make me into sweet red wine

Hanging around like a fruit on a tree

Waiting to be picked, come on cut me free
Come on fill your cup up

Looking for some good luck

Good luck, good luck to you
Hanging like a fruit

Ready to be juiced

Juiced, juiced
Living la dolce vita

Life couldn't get much sweeter
Don't you give me a reason

That it's not the right season

Babe, I love you a lot

I'll give you all I've got

Yeah, you know that it's true
I've been saving all my summers for you

I've been saving all my summers for you
Like froot, like froot
Baby, I am plump and ripe
I'm pinker than shepherd's delight
Sweet like honeysuckle late at night
Leave it too long I'll go rot

Like an apple you forgot

Birds and worms will come for me

The cycle of life is complete
I'm your carnal flower, I'm your bloody rose
Pick my petals off and make my heart explode
I'm your deadly nightshade, I'm your cherry tree
Come on fill your cup up

Looking for some good luck

Good luck, good luck to you
Autumn, I'll be gone

Birds will sing their mourning song

Song
Oh my body is ready
Yeah it's ready, yeah it's ready for your love

Oh my branches are heavy

Yeah they're heavy, yeah they're heavy
Living la dolce vita

I'm in love

Living la dolce vita

I'm in love

I'm in love
Part 1: "Yoncé"
Let me hear you say "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)

Say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls

Posted in the back,
diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim

High like treble, puffing on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this

Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up

We ain't even gonna make it to this club

Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck

He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse

He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown
Oh there daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel

Driver, roll up the partition fast

Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting

He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we’ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping trying not to crash
Oh there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur

Oh baby baby be sweating out my hair
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up

We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?

Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça?

Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?

Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done

Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey
Now we've got problems

And I don't think we can solve 'em

You made a really deep cut

And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Did you have to do this?

I was thinking that you could be trusted

Did you have to ruin what was shiny?

Now it's all rusted
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
I've been drinking, I've been drinking

I get filthy when that liquor get into me

I've been thinking, I've been thinking

Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby? I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice

Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill

Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you, na-na

Drunk in love, I want you
We woke up in the kitchen saying

"How the hell did this shit happen?"

Oh baby, drunk in love

We be all night, last thing I remember is our

Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking,
park it in my lot, 7-11

I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing,
if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right

Armand de Brignac,
gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy's toys

Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard

Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that

Big body been serving all this, swerve

Surfing all in this good-good
Hold up,
that D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself

If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house, time to back up all that mouth

That you had all in the car

Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third

I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side

Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might

Beat the box up like Mike in '97 I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play

"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae," said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights

You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning

Your breasteses is my breakfast, we going in, we be all night
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing

That's keeping me on fire, we on fire

Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty,
daddy, I want you
You and me, we made a vow

For better or for worse
You say I'm crazy

Cause you don't think I know what you've done

But when you call me baby

I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable

Now sadly I know why

Your heart is unobtainable

Even though Lord knows you kept mine
I have loved you for many years
My face above the water

My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground, and it feels like

I can see the sands on the horizon

Everytime you are not around
I'm slowly drifting away (drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream

Pulling against the stream
I wish I could make it easy

Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, to find a way

I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away

Wave after wave, wave after wave

I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream

Pulling against the stream
Greg Kurstin
Jesse Shatkin
Party girls don't get hurt
I'm the one "for a good time call"

Phone’s blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell

I feel the love, feel the love
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink

1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink

1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
Throw 'em back till I lose count
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier

From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night

Feel my tears as they dry, I -
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier

From the chandelier
But I'm holding on for dear life

Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life

Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light

Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

On for tonight
Sun is up, I'm a mess

Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame
When your legs don't work like they used to before

And I can't sweep you off of your feet

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till we're 70

And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23

And I'm thinking about how
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades

And the crowds don't remember my name

When my hands don't play the strings the same way

I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

And I'm thinking about how
People fall in love in mysterious ways

And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh baby, we found love right where we are

And we found love right where we are
The drought was the very worst

When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back-and-forth
You still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
Rain came pouring down

When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you

And I think I am finally clean
There was nothing left to do

When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof

Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
Ten months sober, I must admit

Just because you clean don't mean you don't miss it

Ten months older, I won't give in

Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst

When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
I'm gonna love ya

Until you hate me

And I'm gonna show ya

What's really crazy

You should've known better

Than to mess with me, honey

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya

Gonna love ya, gonna love ya

Like a black widow, baby
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean

Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long

If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got em mirrored

And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer

Now sing...
You used to be thirsty for me

But now you wanna be set free

This is the web, web that you weave

So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works

You ain't never met nobody

That will do ya how I do ya

That will bring you to your knees

Praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it

'Till you feel like you breathe for it

'Till you'll do any and everything for it

I want you to fiend for it

Wake up and dream for it

'Till it's got you gasping for air

And you lean forward
'Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind

And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that

If it's yours and you want it

I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at

I can't fall back or quit
Cause this here is fatal attraction

So I take it all or I don't want shhh

Black, black, black, black widow baby
In the land of gods and monsters, I was an angel

Living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon
You got that medicine I need

Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don’t get along, so now I sing
No one’s gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Hotel sprees, sprees
And I’m singing

"Fuck yeah give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want."
It's innocence lost, innocence lost
In the land of gods and monsters, I was an angel
Looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie, incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art
You got that medicine I need

Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby that's alright with me."
When you talk, it's like a movie and you're makin' me crazy

Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?

You tell me, "Life isn't that hard."
Got the club going up on a Tuesday

Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
She said they call her New New
Ya baby, I'm an 804 nigga
All up in my section, Niggas say no flexing
And my squad love the bricks

They love trapping out the bando
Put a broad on the trip
In the club with my strap, in case a nigga want to test me
My killers don't know how to act, snipe a nigga like Wesley
this ain't what you want
I hit it then pass her to Trigga
play with that pussy like a banjo
What would I do without your smart mouth

Drawing me in, and you kicking me out

Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can’t pin you down

What’s going on in that beautiful mind
I’m on your magical mystery ride
And I’m so dizzy, don’t know what hit me, but I’ll be alright
My head’s under water

But I’m breathing fire

You’re crazy and I’m out of my mind
‘Cause all of me

Loves all of you

Love your curves and all your edges

All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me

I’ll give my all to you

You’re my end and my beginning

Even when I lose I’m winning

‘Cause I give you all of me

And you give me all of you
How many times do I have to tell you

Even when you’re crying you’re beautiful too

The world is beating you down, I’m around through every mood

You’re my downfall, you’re my muse

My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues

I can’t stop singing, it’s ringing, in my head for you
Cards on the table, we’re both showing hearts

Risking it all, though it’s hard
I give you all of me

And you give me all of you
Looking at it now

It all seemed so simple

We were lying on your couch

I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)

The rest of the world is black and white

But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinkin'
Are we out of the woods yet?

Are we out of the woods yet?

Are we out of the woods yet?

Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?

Are we in the clear yet?

Are we in the clear yet?

In the clear yet? Good
Looking at it now

Last December (last december)

We were built to fall apart

And fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget, when we decided

We decided, to move the furniture so we could dance

Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?

20 stitches in the hospital room
And you started cryin', baby I did too

But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat

I walked out and said I'm settin' you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees

And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me

You were lookin' at me

You were lookin' at me, ooh
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters

Trust me, mine is better
Cause baby I could build a castle

Out of all the bricks they threw at me
Come along with me

Heartbreak is the national anthem

We sing it proudly

We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet

Baby we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
We need love but all we want is danger
The rumors are terrible and cruel

But honey most of them are true
Different
This one goes out to all the lovers
What can we do? We're helpless romantics
We can not help who we're attracted to

So let's all dance, and elevate each other
Dear diary, it's happenin' again

This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear

She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Queen Cleopatra please

Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me

I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl

Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
Why, why do I have to lie?

Pretend, make believe or hide her?
When I love what I've described

But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl
What's wrong with that?

What's wrong with that? Yeah

What's wrong with that?
In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it

We say thank you, and we take it back
Wished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true

Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you

Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?
You told me I don't love you, don't say that
I know that I fucked up, one time

Don't right me off for life, it ain't right

How many sorrys will it take?

How much of me talking and setting straight?

Don't even remember the girls name

You're my forever and that won't change
You said you only ever wanted honesty

I'm standing here tryin' to give you all of me

Don't tell me that you're love is running cold for me

When we both know that's not true
I dropped a tear in the ocean

When they find it, that's when I'll stop loving you
Who knows where to touch you like me?

Who's gonna love you like me?

Who's gonna run to you when you're lonely?

Oh you know it's me, girl you know it's me
If you're only as good as the company you keep

Then I'mma blame you for what they say about me
(Free your mind, and let your conscience be free)
When I was by myself I was fast asleep

Since you came around I've been up for weeks
(Free your mind, and let your conscience be free)
Yi-yi-yikes I've been with the wrong crowd
I can make you  a believer, if I turn the nonsense down
I keep my secrets in a safehouse, better if I don't speak
Devil's tryna tempt me, they just outline my shape out

Place me at the crime scene
I can see from this high up, you ain't got a heart girl

Privacy is for the cheater, obviously you're deceiving
I know

I know just who you are
You put me on lay away
You just love to heart shop

I think that it's over

I think that it's over
I swear to God I'm moving on

(Mm, back up)

I ain't going back no more, I ain't going back no more

I ain't going back no more, I ain't going back no more

(I ain't tripping of you you you you)

I ain't going back no more, I ain't going back no more

(I ain't tripping of you you you)

I ain't going back no more, I ain't going back no more
You just start a fight, I ain't fighting back I'm cool with it

I, simply came here to party

Why, would I trip off that bullshit, when I'm on that good shit
I swear to God I'm moving on

(Mm, back up)
Substitute love for a better thing
I deal with my pain like a lonely child
I didn't build these walls for you to piss all on my castle

Go ahead burn it down, I'mma build me another one

All these clouds...
First things first, I'm the realest (realest)

Drop this and let the whole world feel it (let 'em feel it)

And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm giving lessons in physics (right, right?)
You should want a bad bitch like this (huh?)

Drop it low and pick it up just like this (yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist (on my wrist)
Taking all the liquor straight, never chase that (never)
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back (what?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spilling, you should taste that
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh
I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this

Can't stand no haters, and honest, the truth is

And my flow retarded, each beat dear, departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline

And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?

Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that 
, put my name in 
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw
Trash the hotel, let's get drunk on the minibar
Make the phone call, feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah I’m deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch, aow!
Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that
That's just the way you like it, huh?

And so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down nothing
Slayin' these hoes, gold trigger on the gun like
Who that, who that? 

That do that, do that, 

Who that, who that? 

(Blow-oh-oh-oh)
1 life, 2 children
3 time, 4 dreaming
(Last night) Our lovers' quarrel (I was thinking about you)
Hurt more than I can say (And it was kind of dirty)
All night (And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here! (It was kind of nasty, aah!)

Help me here! (It was kind of trashy)
Cause I can't help my mind from going there!
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend

Wanna meet at my place?

Heard that we both got nothing to do...
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

Last night

Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)

Doing really nasty things (you were in my)

Damn, you were in my sex dreams (don't stop the party)

Making love in my sex dreams (4x)
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
(cause I'm broken)
white- (by the one before) glove
(And I feel so trashy)

Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!
Let's keep it naughty (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)

Tomorrow when I run into you, Tomorrow when I run into you
In love as I am when I lay with you

I think of  him, I think of him
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...

Oh my God!
We were in the swimming pool
and I wrote this song while we made love

Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies
and now's the time for the trial with doubts and drawls
I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind

Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh

Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far

If we are, we're taking this a little too far

Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far

We're taking this a little too far

We're taking this a little too far
Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl

One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl

Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl

One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should

Wassup....
On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom

Alone in my place, my heart is away

All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away
Stop making a big deal out of the little things

Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine

Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine

All I'm really asking for is you

You're mine, you're mine

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine

Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine

As long as you know who you belong to
From 8 until late, I think ‘bout you
You own my nights I don’t know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should
I gotta pull up on you

You gon make me have to pull up on you
Don’t go ghost on me, I'mma go Thriller on you, I'mma just
I'mma let my hands do the talking when I see you baby girl

I miss feeling on you, I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you
I been about you and I’m still about you but

We ain't finished talking
I told you you don’t need to worry about them bitches

All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking
Cuz they don’t wanna see you happier than them and girl you swear they all
Your friends and there's been a problem
You the one they hate, just come with daddy
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back

But that nigga came running back
And you tell me that you’re done with that

And I believe it's true as long as you know who you belong to
All I’m really asking for is you

Long as you know who you belong to
We're a thousand miles from comfort

We have travelled land and sea
But as long as you are with me

There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever

Exulted in the scene
As long as I am with you

My heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance I would take it

It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I rather be (3x)
We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
As long as we're together, there's no place I'd rather be
I stay out too late, got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, that's what people say
I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay

At least that's what people say, that's what people say
But I keep cruisin', can't stop, won't stop movin'

It's like I got this music in my mind sayin' it's gonna be alright
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play

And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

I shake it off,  I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break

And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

I shake it off, I shake it off
I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightnin' on my feet

And that's what they don’t see, that's what they don’t see
I'm dancin' on my own, I'll make the moves up as I go

And that's what they don't know, that’s what they don’t know
But I keep cruisin', can't stop, won't stop groovin'

It's like I got this music in my mind sayin' it's gonna be alright
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Hey, hey, hey, just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and dirty, dirty cheats of the world you could have been getting down to this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend

She's like “oh my God”, but I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say

Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way
(Because I'm happy)

Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)

Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)

Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Here come bad news, talking this and that (Yeah!)

Well, give me all you got, don't hold it back (Yeah!)
Bring me down

Can't nothing bring me down

My level's too high to bring me down

Can't nothing bring me down, I said...
A new disease in my town called Idiotic

Every pretty lady in my city got it, point blank
Periodically empty seats, dine at Cipriani's
Like Beyoncé, they're getting by or they get embodied

So Sasha Fierce
Rolling down her cheeks, crying till she's sound asleep
Preach, pray that today is not a lonely one

You gotta know you not the only one

You and me, we made a vow

For better or for worse

I can't believe you let me down

But the proof is in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts

Denying every tear

I wish this would be over now

But I know that I still need you here



You say I'm crazy

Cause you don't think I know what you've done

But when you call me baby

I know I'm not the only one



You've been so unavailable

Now sadly I know why

Your heart is unobtainable

Even though Lord knows you kept mine


We all guilty of the same crime

If you ask me, I might've had a couple women at the same time
But you handle the pressure, Jack Daniels for breakfast

A cap of valium mixed with antidepressants, precious
My momma said that we need love

Till I found out life's a bitch with no prenup, you're on your own
Divorces or court splits, decisions and choices

The Porsche or the fortress? Ignore it or forefeit
I love your face

You love the taste
I kiss you and you lick your lips, I kiss you and you lick your lips
You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I
I know you never waste a drip, I know you never waste a drip
I wonder how it feels sometimes

Must be good to you
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going

Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning

Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning

Don't stop screaming, freaking, 
blowing
Can you eat my skittles?

It's the sweetest in the middle (yeah)

Pink is the flavor

Solve the riddle (yeah)
I'm-a lean back

Don't worry it's nothing major

Make sure you clean that

It's the only way to get the

Flavor
When you're thirsty and need love

I give it up 'til I'm empty babe
I'm about to get into this, girls

This is for all the grown women out there
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out

Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out

Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

I want you to

Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

I want you to

Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

I want you to

Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

I want you to

Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
Ooh I've had a naughty thought today, baby
Every time I close my eyes
Ooh get a glimpse of this candy paint

Don’t slip off when it drip off on top of your ride
When you see it here, lift it up then toss it babe

I know everything you want
I'm-a show you how I stroke (stroke it)
Bring ya work home on top of me

I'm-a let you be the, be the boss of me
I know everything you want
Give me that daddy long stroke
Je ne sais quoi

Cherie, m'vle-ou

Aswe ya ce net al kole!
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand

But I still need love cause I'm just a man

These nights never seem to go to plan

I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Oh won't you stay with me?

Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see

But darling, stay with me
Why am I so emotional?

No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works

But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
You stand with your hand on my waistline

It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight

I can hear them whisper as we pass by

It's a bad sign (bad sign)
Something happens when everybody finds out

See the vultures circling dark clouds
Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes

And guns

They are the hunters, we are the foxes

And we run
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time

Not this time
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it

My love

They are the hunters, we are the foxes

And we run

Was she the girl that’s from the video?

Was she the girl that’s from the video?

Was she the girl that’s from the video?

You lie, you lie, you lie
Nineteen, too keen

Looking at the game, though

Trying to make a stand for the main squeeze
Please, you don’t stand a chance

Stop acting like you can
The camera on you ain’t that enough?

You’re looking for the all round good love
Stop, stop lying to me
The camera loves you, ain’t that enough?

You’re craving for the whole universe

So nothing’s gonna get in your way

You’re gonna get yourself broke one day
I can’t recognize me
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek

Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated when I blew, see
But it was confusing,
cause all I wanted to do's be

The Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam

Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep

One sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think

Cause I'm...
Well, that's nothing
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders

No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wandering off down yonder

And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen

Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster

And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it

My OCD is conking me in the head,
keep knockin'

Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'

I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying

Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...
Call me crazy, but I have this vision

One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm

Coming straight at MCs, blood gets spilled
and I'll

Take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track

Give every kid who got played that,
pumped up feelin'

And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children

But if one kid out of a hundred million

Who are going through a struggle feels it and

Relates, that's great,
it's payback, Russell Wilson

Falling way back in the draft, turn nothing into something, still can

Make that,
straw into gold chump, I will spin

Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts

I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the...

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much

You should aim to be successful, but not too successful

Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my 

Always 
  that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage

And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors

Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a 

But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social

Political, and economic equality of the sexes

She sees them walking in a straight line, that's not really her style

They all got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible and she's just in the background
And she says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in

I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids
He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they're living the good life, can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going

In the fast lane, living life without knowing

And he says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

And they said
I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in

Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more

Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
Welcome to New York!

It's been waiting for you

Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York!

It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack

I can dance to this beat (beat)

Forevermore
The lights are so bright

But they never blind me (me)

Welcome to New York!

It's been waiting for you

Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors

Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want

Boys and boys and girls and girls
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing

Like any real love, it's ever-changing

Like any true love, it drives you crazy

But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air said show me something

He said if you dare come a little closer
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it

Something in the way you move

Makes me feel like I can't live without you

And it takes me all the way

I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take it's given
Round and around and around and around we go

Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
The reason I hold on

Cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one

But I'm the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the light

It's hard to know which one of us is caving
I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones

It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me
I move through town, I’m quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it
And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home

People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes

I’m done with it (ooh)
This is the start of how it ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the

Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We’re at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now

People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison

And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me

I’m done with it (ooh)
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat

Sparking up my heart

And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat
I'm jealous of the rain

That falls upon your skin

It's closer than my hands have been

I'm jealous of the rain

I'm jealous of the wind

That ripples through your clothes

It's closer than your shadow

Oh, I'm jealous of the wind, cause
I wished you the best of

All this world could give
People like you always want back

The love they gave away

And people like me wanna believe you

When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now

The less I know
All I know is that you drove us

Off the road
(Stay) hey

All you had to do was stay

Had me in the palm of your hands

Then why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay) hey
Now you say you want it back

Now that it's just too late

Well could have been easy
All you had to do was (stay)

All you had to do was (stay)

All you had to do was (stay)

All you had to do was (stay)

All you had to do was stay
Here you are now calling me up

But I don't know what to say

I've been picking up the pieces

Of the mess you made
People like you always want back

The love they pushed aside

But people like me are gone forever

When you say goodbye
Let me remind you

This was what you wanted

You ended it
All the times I have laid in your light

When your love kept me safe through the night
And before time demands our goodbye

Can you sing me a last lullaby?
Pretend shit doesn't get to me

And I suffer in silence when I'm hurting

A man's problems are his own

And it's my burden
Off the rails, my train of thought's wandering
I look up to the sky

And it falls,
Like it's only when I'm leathered that I sleep better
It just makes my day harder, I wonder if

It would've been any different if I had a father that I knew

Could it have helped shape the way that I grew?
I hide everything that's going on inside

Guess it's been a while since I've been honest, I need help

But I deny it and even lie to myself like I'm fine
To see even a glimmer of hope in the darkness

Is hard and depression is a slippery slope

I don't wanna do what my dad did with a rope, though

So I carry on even though it's hard to
The only thing that's definite is death and things always change

As long as you give em a chance to
(Can you sing me a last lullaby?)
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg...
Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby

High price, but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby

Gettin' faded in the European, swervin', ayy
Look, describe Iggy groundbreaking what the word is
Hit the stage, ass shaking like I'm nervous
When in New York, I be parkin' right on Madison

This ain't no accident, I'm killing 'em on purpose
I-G-G... why did she just have to do it

Baby ride with me, fly living, there ain't nothing to it
And my waist slim, ass fat, you gotta have it

Get my bake on, cake long

That's automatic
I know you like the way I turn it on

I'm out here with my friends

I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

If you don't do this right, you're going home alone

I guess you'll have to beg

I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
P-P-P-Pussy power, pay me by the hour
I need me a Braveheart, can't deal with a coward
I tell him if he ain't ballin', he should hit the showers

If I pick you, you lucky, baby, this money ours
All yellow gold on me, like I'm Trinidad (James)
Sittin' drop top, wondering where the ceiling's at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back

But I got a new thang, baby, I ain't feeling that now
Iggy Iggy Iggy, can't you see?

That everybody wanna put they hands on me
And I need another hand with all these bands on me, wait
Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?

Talking all this trash like blah-de-blah-de-blah

(Oh ay oh) nuh-uh (oh ay oh) nuh-uh (oh ay oh)

Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?

Make me wanna laugh like har-de-har-de-har

(Oh ay oh) nuh-uh (oh ay oh) nuh-uh
Got you hooked boy, I'm like a drug

If you want my love better smoke it up

(Make you beg for it, I'mma make you beg for it)

You can look, boy, but don't you touch

If you want my love make me give a fuck

(Make you beg for it, I'mma make you beg for it)
Say something, I'm giving up on you

I'll be the one, if you want me to

Anywhere, I would've followed you

Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small

It was over my head

I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall

I'm still learning to love

Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you

I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you

Anywhere, I would've followed you

Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love

And I'm saying goodbye
Say something, I'm giving up on you

Say something...
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one

Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me

I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em

But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'mma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'mma do something I do it,
I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shitting
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse

He's married to the game
like a "fuck you" for Christmas

His gift is a curse
forget the earth he's got the urge

To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand

We'll walk this road together
, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm

Just letting you know that you're not alone

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words

In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth

For that fuck your feelings

Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh”
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back,
click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out

Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons

These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage

I'm standing up, I'mma face my
demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground

I've had enough, now I'm so fed up

Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me

Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through

And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I have been through the wringer, 
but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye,
I feel like the king of

My world,
haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof

Like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up

Cause I'm raising the bar
I shoot for the moon

But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing
and...
