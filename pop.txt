My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit

Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins

Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace

Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish

Now that's real, real, real

Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill

Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils

I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill

I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?

He can tell I ain't missing no meals

Come through and fuck him in my automobile

Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill

And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal

Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab

So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like

Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

(Look at her butt)

Look at, look at, look at

Look, at her butt
This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles

Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's

Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle

Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil

Now that bang, bang, bang

I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine

He toss my salad like his name Romaine

And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain

I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?

He can tell I ain't missing no meals

Come through and fuck him in my automobile

Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill

And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal

He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab

So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like

Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

(Look at her butt)

Look at, look at, look at

Look, at her butt
Little in the middle but she got much back

Little in the middle but she got much back

Little in the middle but she got much back

(Oh my God, look at her butt)
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

Don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Look, at her butt
Yeah, he love this fat ass, ha haha!

Yeah! This one is for my bitches with a fat ass in the fucking club

I said, where my fat ass big bitches in the club?

Fuck the skinny bitches! Fuck the skinny bitches in the club!

I wanna see all the big fat ass bitches in the muthafuckin' club

Fuck you if you skinny bitches, what?! Kyuh

Ha ha, ha ha

I got a big fat ass (ass, ass, ass)

Come on!
[Verse]

What would I do without your smart mouth

Drawing me in, and you kicking me out

You got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down

What's going on in that beautiful mind

I'm on your magical mystery ride

And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
[Bridge]

My head's underwater

But I'm breathing fine

You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
[Chorus]

'Cause all of me

Loves all of you

Love your curves and all your edges

All your perfect imperfections

Give your all to me

I'll give my all to you

You're my end and my beginning

Even when I lose I'm winning

Cause I give you all of me

And you give me all of you, oh
[Verse]

How many times do I have to tell you

Even when you're crying you're beautiful too

The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood

You're my downfall, you're my muse

My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues

I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you
[Bridge]

My head's underwater

But I'm breathing fine

You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
[Chorus]

'Cause all of me

Loves all of you

Love your curves and all your edges

All your perfect imperfections

Give your all to me

I'll give my all to you

You're my end and my beginning

Even when I lose I'm winning

Cause I give you all of me

And you give me all of you, oh

Give me all of you, oh oh
[Bridge]

Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts

Risking it all though it's hard
[Chorus]

Cause all of me

Loves all of you

Love your curves and all your edges

All your perfect imperfections

Give your all to me

I'll give my all to you

You're my end and my beginning

Even when I lose I'm winning

Cause I give you all of me

And you give me all of you
I give you all of me

And you give me all, of you, oh oh oh.
When your legs don't work like they used to before

And I can't sweep you off of your feet

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70

And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23

And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways

Maybe just the touch of a hand

Oh me I fall in love with you every single day

And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now

Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart

I'm thinking out loud

Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades

And the crowds don't remember my name

When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm

I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen

Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways

Maybe it's all part of a plan

I just keep on making the same mistakes

Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now

Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart

I'm thinking out loud

That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
(Ah la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la)
So baby now

Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart

I'm thinking out loud

That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are

And we found love right where we are
Yo te miro y se me corta la respiraciÃ³n

Cuando tÃº me miras se me sube el corazÃ³n

(Me palpita lento el corazÃ³n)

Y en un silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras

La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)

Tu cuerpo y el mÃ­o llenando el vacÃ­o

Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)

(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)

Ese fuego por dentro me va enloqueciendo

Me va saturando
Con tu fÃ­sica y tu quÃ­mica tambiÃ©n tu anatomÃ­a

La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la mÃ­a

Ya no puedo mÃ¡s (ya no puedo mÃ¡s)

Ya no puedo mÃ¡s (ya no puedo mÃ¡s)

Con esta melodÃ­a, tu color, tu fantasÃ­a

Con tu filosofÃ­a mi cabeza estÃ¡ vacÃ­a

Y ya no puedo mÃ¡s (ya no puedo mÃ¡s)

Ya no puedo mÃ¡s (ya no puedo mÃ¡s)
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo

Bailar contigo, tener contigo

Una noche loca (una noche loca)

Y besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)

Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo

Bailar contigo, tener contigo una noche loca

Con tremenda nota
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
TÃº me miras y me llevas a otra dimensiÃ³n

(Estoy en otra dimensiÃ³n)

Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazÃ³n

(Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazÃ³n)

QuÃ© ironÃ­a del destino no poder tocarte

Abrazarte y sentir la magia de tu olor
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)

Tu cuerpo y el mio llenando el vacÃ­o

Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)

(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)

Ese fuego por dentro me va enloqueciendo

Me va saturando
Con tu fÃ­sica y tu quÃ­mica tambiÃ©n tu anatomÃ­a

La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la mÃ­a

Ya no puedo mÃ¡s (ya no puedo mÃ¡s)

Ya no puedo mÃ¡s (ya no puedo mÃ¡s)

Con esta melodÃ­a, tu color, tu fantasÃ­a

Con tu filosofÃ­a mi cabeza estÃ¡ vacÃ­a

Y ya no puedo mÃ¡s (ya no puedo mÃ¡s)

Ya no puedo mÃ¡s (ya no puedo mÃ¡s)
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo

Bailar contigo, tener contigo

Una noche loca (una noche loca)

Y besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)

Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo

Bailar contigo, tener contigo una noche loca

Con tremenda loca
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

Ooooh bailando amor ooooh

Bailando amor ooooh es que se me va el dolor

Ooooh).
Anna:

Elsa?

(Knocking: Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock)

Do you wanna build a snowman?

Come on lets go and play

I never see you anymore

Come out the door

It's like you've gone away-

We used to be best buddies

And now we're not

I wish you would tell me why!-

Do you wanna build a snowman?

It doesn't have to be a snowman.
Elsa:

Go away, Anna
Anna:

Okay, bye...
(Knocking)

Do you wanna build a snowman?

Or ride our bikes around the halls

I think some company is overdue

I've started talking to

the pictures on the walls-

(Hang in there, Joan!)

It gets a little lonely

All these empty rooms,
Just watching the hours tick by-

(Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock)
(Orchestral)
Anna:

(Knocking)

Elsa?

Please, I know you're in there,

People are asking where you've been

They say "have courage", and I'm trying to

I'm right out here for you, just let me in

We only have each other

It's just you and me

What are we gonna do?
Do you wanna build a Snowman?
(Verse 1)

Heart beats fast

Colors and promises

How to be brave

How can I love when I'm afraid

To fall

But watching you stand alone

All of my doubt

Suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
(Chorus)

I have died every day

waiting for you

Darlin' don't be afraid

I have loved you for a

Thousand years

I'll love you for a

Thousand more
(Verse 2)

Time stands still

beauty in all she is

I will be brave

I will not let anything

Take away

What's standing in front of me

Every breath,

Every hour has come to this
One step closer
(Chorus)

I have died every day

Waiting for you

Darlin' don't be afraid

I have loved you for a

Thousand years

I'll love you for a

Thousand more
And all along I believed

I would find you

Time has brought

Your heart to me

I have loved you for a

Thousand years

I'll love you for a

Thousand more
One step closer

One step closer
(Chorus)

I have died every day

Waiting for you

Darlin' don't be afraid,

I have loved you for a

Thousand years

I'll love you for a

Thousand more
And all along I believed

I would find you

Time has brought

Your heart to me

I have loved you for a

Thousand years

I'll love you for a

Thousand more
Let it go, let it go

Can't hold it back anymore

Let it go, Let it go

Turn my back and slam the door
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight

Not a footprint to be seen

A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

Couldn't keep it in

Heaven knows I tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see

Be the good girl you always had to be

Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

Well now they know
Let it go, let it go

Can't hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go

Turn my back and slam the door

And here I stand

And here I'll stay

Let it go, let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small

And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all

Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe

I know I left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieve
Let it go, Let it go

Can't hold it back anymore

Let it go, Let it go,

Turn my back and slam the door

And here I stand

And here I'll stay

Let it go, let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway
Standing - frozen in the life I've chosen

You won't find me, the past is so behind me

Buried in the snow
Let it go, let it go

Can't hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go,

Turn my back and slam the door

And here I stand

And here I'll stay

Let it go, let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway...

(let the music go on)

let it go, let it go

Let it go, let it go
She got a body like an hourglass

I heard that you're settled down

That you found a girl and you're married now

I heard that your dreams came true

Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?

Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited

But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded

That for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

I wish nothing but the best for you, too

Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies

Only yesterday was the time of our lives

We were born and raised in a summer haze

Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited

But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded

That for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

I wish nothing but the best for you, too

Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
Nothing compares, no worries or cares

Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made

Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

I wish nothing but the best for you

Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

I wish nothing but the best for you, too

Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
I'm gonna love you

Until you hate me

And I'm gonna show you

What's really crazy

You should've known better

Then to mess with me, heartache

I'm gonna lie to you, I'm gonna lie to you

Gonna lie to you, gonna lie to you

Like a black widow, baby
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same

First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray

We went from nothing to something liking to loving

It was us against the world now we just fucking

It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you

Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you

I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between

By me believing what you say that you never mean

Like It'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long

If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song

You was different from my last but now you got a mirror

But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer

Now sing
You used to be thirsty for me

But now you wanna be set free

This is the web, the web that you weave

So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love you

Until you hate me

And I'm gonna show you

What's really crazy

You should've known better

Then to mess with me, heartache

I'm gonna lie to you, I'm gonna lie to you

Gonna lie to you, gonna lie to you

Like a black widow, baby
I'm gonna love you until it hurts

Just to get you I'm doing whatever works

You'd have never met nobody

That will do you how I do ya

That will bring you to your knees

Praise Jesus hallelujah

Imma make you beg for it, plead for it

Till you feel like you breath for it

Till you do any and everything for it

I want you to fiend for it

Wake up and dream for it

Till it's got you gasping for air

And you leave for it

Til then having kids, can check on your mind

And there's nothing but me on it

Now it's me time believe that

If it's yours when you want it

I wouldn't promise I need that

Till I'm everywhere that you be at

I can't fall back go quick

'Cause this here is fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shit
You used to be thirsty for me

But now you wanna be set free

This is the web, the web that you weave

So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love you

Until you hate me

And I'm gonna show you

What's really crazy

You should've known better

Then to mess with me, heartache

I'm gonna lie to you, I'm gonna lie to you

Gonna lie to you, gonna lie to you

Like a black widow, baby
A tornado flew around my room before you came

Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain

In Southern California, much like Arizona

My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you

(Ooh, no, no, no)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you

(You know, know, know)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you

Do you think about me still?

Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)

'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)

'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh)

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool

Enough to kick it

Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho

Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute

That's why I kissed you

Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you

(Ooh, no, no, no)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you

(You know, know, know)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you

Do you think about me still?

Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)

'Cause I been thinkin' 'about forever (Oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)

'Cause I been thinkin' 'about forever (Oooh)
Yes, of course

I remember, how could I forget?

How you feel?

You know, you were my first time

A new feel

It won't ever get old, not in my soul not in

my spirit, keep it alive

We'll go down this road

'Til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)

'Cause I been thinkin' 'about forever (Oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)

'Cause I been thinkin' 'about forever (Oooh)
It's just another night

And I'm staring at the moon

I saw a shooting star

And thought of you

I sang a lullaby

By the waterside and knew

If you were here,

I'd sing to you

You're on the other side

As the skyline splits in two

I'm miles away from seeing you

I can see the stars

From America

I wonder, do you see them, too?
So open your eyes and see

The way our horizons meet

And all of the lights will lead

Into the night with me

And I know these scars will bleed

But both of our hearts believe

All of these stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart

On the radio beat

They're playing 'Chasing Cars'

And I thought of us

Back to the time,

You were lying next to me

I looked across and fell in love

So I took your hand

Back through lamp lit streets I knew

Everything led back to you

So can you see the stars?

Over Amsterdam

You're the song my heart is

Beating to
So open your eyes and see

The way our horizons meet

And all of the lights will lead

Into the night with me

And I know these scars will bleed

But both of our hearts believe

All of these stars will guide us home
And, oh, I know

And oh, I know, oh

I can see the stars

From America
There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark

Finally I can see you crystal clear

[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I leave with every piece of you

Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch

And it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

We could have had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played it, to the beat

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Baby, I have no story to be told

But I've heard one on you

And I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair

Make a home down there

As mine sure won't be shared
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

The scars of your love remind me of us

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

I can't help feeling

We could have had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played it, to the beat

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

But you played it, with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door (woah)

Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

We could have had it all

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

It all, it all, it all

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played it to the beat

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it

You played it

You played it

You played it to the beat.
Put your make-up on

Get your nails done

Curl your hair

Run the extra mile

Keep it slim so they like you, do they like you?
Get your sexy on

Don't be shy, girl

Take it off

This is what you want, to belong, so they like you

Do you like you?
You don't have to try so hard

You don't have to, give it all away

You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up

You don't have to change a single thing
You don't have to try, try, try, try

You don't have to try, try, try, try

You don't have to try, try, try, try

You don't have to try

You don't have to try
Mm, mm
Get your shopping on, at the mall, max your credit cards

You don't have to choose, buy it all, so they like you

Do they like you?
Wait a second,

Why, should you care, what they think of you

When you're all alone, by yourself, do you like you?

Do you like you?
You don't have to try so hard

You don't have to, give it all away

You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up

You don't have to change a single thing

You don't have to try

You don't have to try
Take your make-up off

Let your hair down

Take a breath

Look into the mirror, at yourself

Don't you like you?

'Cause I like you
Right from the start

You were a thief

You stole my heart

And I your willing victim

I let you see the parts of me

That weren't all that pretty

And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh

Things you never say to me, oh, oh

Tell me that you've had enough

Of our love, our love
Just give me a reason

Just a little bit's enough

Just a second we're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars

It's been written in the scars on our hearts

We're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again
I'm sorry I don't understand

Where all of this is coming from

I thought that we were fine

(Oh, we had everything)

Your head is running wild again

My dear we still have everythin'

And it's all in your mind

(Yeah, but this is happenin')
You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh

You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh

There's nothing more than empty sheets

Between our love, our love

Oh, our love, our love
Just give me a reason

Just a little bit's enough

Just a second we're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again

I never stopped

You're still written in the scars on my heart

You're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again
Oh, tear ducts can rust

I'll fix it for us

We're collecting dust

But our love's enough

You're holding it in

You're pouring a drink

No nothing is as bad as it seems

We'll come clean
Just give me a reason

Just a little bit's enough

Just a second we're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars

It's been written in the scars on our hearts

That we're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason

Just a little bit's enough

Just a second we're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars

It's been written in the scars on our hearts

That we're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again
Oh, we can learn to love again

Oh, we can learn to love again

Oh, oh, that we're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted

I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted

And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?

When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?

If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving

I remember the make-up running down your face

And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them

Like every single wish we ever made

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia

And forget about the stupid little things

Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you

And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone

I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone

And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on

It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?

If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving

I remember the make-up running down your face

And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them

Like every single wish we ever made

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia

And forget about the stupid little things

Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you

And the memories I never can escape
If today I woke up with you right beside me

Like all of this was just some twisted dream

I'd hold you closer than I ever did before

And you'd never slip away

And you'd never hear me say
I remember the day you told me you were leaving

I remember the make-up running down your face

And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them

Like every single wish we ever made

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia

And forget about the stupid little things

Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you

And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

No, I'm really not fine at all

Tell me this is just a dream

'Cause I'm really not fine at all
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining

Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying

She's so beautiful

And I tell her everyday.
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me

And it's so, it's so sad to think that she doesn't see what I see

But every time she ask me do I look okay?

I say
When I see your face

There's not a thing that I would change

'Cause you're amazing

Just the way you are
And when you smile

The whole world stops and stares for a while

'Cause girl, you're amazing

Just the way you are
Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me

Her laugh her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy

She's so beautiful

And I tell her everyday
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change

If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same

So don't even bother asking if you look okay

You know I'll say
When I see your face

There's not a thing that I would change

'Cause girl you're amazing

Just the way you are
And when you smile

The whole world stops and stares for a while

'Cause girl, you're amazing

Just the way you are
The way you are

The way you are

Girl, you're amazing

Just the way you are
When I see your face

There's not a thing that I would change

'Cause girl you're amazing

Just the way you are
And when you smile

The whole world stops and stares for a while

'Cause girl, you're amazing

Just the way you are.

yeah yeah

oh beby i love you i love you beby i can not belive i have you i am so lucky
Uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh

I eat my dinner in my bathtub

Then I go to sex clubs

Watching freaky people getting it on

It doesn't make me nervous

If anything I'm restless

Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies

Binge on all my Twinkies

Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep

And I drank up all my money

Tasted kind of lonely
You're gone and I got to stay high

All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh

High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh

Spend my days locked in a haze

Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down

Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you
Pick up daddies at the playground

How I spend my day time

Loosen up the frown, make them feel alive

I make it fast and greasy

I know my way too easy
You're gone and I got to stay high

All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh

High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh

Spend my days locked in a haze,

Tryin' to forget you babe, I fall back down

Got to stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you
Staying in my play pretend

Where the fun ain't got no end

Oh, can't go home alone again

Need someone to numb the pain

Oh, staying in my play pretend

Where the fun ain't got no end

Oh oh can't go home alone again

Need someone to numb the pain
You're gone and I got to stay high

All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh

High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh

Spend my days locked in a haze

Tryin' to forget you babe, I fall back down

Got to stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you

We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down

We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down

We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down

We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down

I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm on fire

I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm a fireball
I met this girl late last year

She said don't you worry if I disappear

I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake

I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait

But then I jumped right in a week later returned

I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn

But I gave her my time, for two or three nights

Then I put it on pause until the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again

She told me I was never looking for a friend

Maybe you can swing by my room around ten

Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin

Well be in between the sheets till' the late AM

Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said

She's singing
Don't fuck with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my own

I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love

I told her, she knows

Take aim and reload

I don't wanna know that babe
For a couple of weeks I only want to see her

We drink away the days with a take away pizza

Before a text message was the only way to reach her

Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her

Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature

And never wants to sleep I guess that I dont want to either

But me and her we make money the same way

Four cities, two planes the same day

And those shows have never been what its about

Maybe well go together and just figure it out

I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch

But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now

Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out

When she was kissing him how

I was confused about

She should figure it out

Why I'm sat here singing
Don't fuck with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my own

I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love

I told her, she knows

Take aim and reload

I don't wanna know that babe
On my hotel door

I don't even know if she knows what for

She was crying on my shoulder

I already told you

Trust and respect is what we do this for

I never intended to be next

But you didn't need to to take him to bed, thats all

And I never saw him as a threat

Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course

Its not like we were both on tour

We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor

And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment

But it was never just fun and I thought you were different

This is not the way you realize that you want it

It's a bit too much too late if I'm honest

And all this time God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my own

I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love

I told her, she knows

Take aim and reload

I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my own

I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love

I told her, she knows

Take aim and reload

I don't wanna know that babe
