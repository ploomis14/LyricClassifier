I mean for real, fuck how you feel

Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah
And everyday I wake up celebratin' shit, why?

Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch

Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South

I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew

I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more

Yeah we in the buildin' but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up

It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl

I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up

I guess drama makes for the best content

Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til your unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch

Just don't forget to read the fine print

Dinner with my man on a G5, is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet

Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky

Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July

Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only

Rich niggas only, independent bitches only

Boss niggas only, thick bitches only

I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man

But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach

I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video

You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt

But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key or maybe high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know

Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?

I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree

Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up

So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, aye)
I never fucked Nic and that's fucked up

If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up

Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right

Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth

Then I make you burp boy,
treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses, with army guns
So think about, your son and daughter rooms

Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns

Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms

Extendo long as an extension cord

Why you wanna go flex? Like you all in the mix

And they want to make a flick for the camera

Wanna be Kim Kardashian, heard I was living like a bachelor
Spend it how I like, yah, sinning every night, yah
Push start the whip, hey, brought it straight to life, for life

"That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog."
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out

To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you

Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember? I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top

You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg

Damn, okay, from that perspective

I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that

Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at

But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all

But when they need a favor,
