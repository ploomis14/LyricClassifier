I mean for real, fuck how you feel

Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah
And everyday I wake up celebratin' shit, why?

Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch

Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South

I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth

Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew

I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more

I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up

It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl

I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up

I guess drama makes for the best content

Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til your unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch

Dinner with my man on a G5, is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet

Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky

Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July

Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only

Rich niggas only, independent bitches only

Boss niggas only, thick bitches only

I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man

But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach

I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video

You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt

But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key or maybe high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know

I mean, it doesn‚Äôt take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I‚Äôm obsessed with thick women and I agree

Yeah, that‚Äôs right, I like my girls BBW, yeah

Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that‚Äôs cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up

So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, aye)
I never fucked Nic and that's fucked up

If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up

Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right

Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth

Then I make you burp boy,
treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses, with army guns
So think about, your son and daughter rooms

Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns

Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off

I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off

Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't

Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully,

Chop the top off the Porsche, that's a headless horse
Extendo long as an extension cord
Bitch, I ball like Jordan and I play full court

Then you know I got to keep this shit short
Why you wanna go flex? Like you all in the mix

Like you got some shit popping off
I got some models that you see up in the movies

And they want to make a flick for the camera

Wanna be Kim Kardashian, heard I was living like a bachelor
Spend it how I like, yah, sinning every night, yah
Push start the whip, hey, brought it straight to life, for life
Blowing on the kush, blowing, 'til I'm out of sight, I'm gone

I give a fuck about your mob boy
I'm the real 6 God boy
I'm about to say a true thing

I'm about to say a true thing
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain

It's a OVO come through murk things

I know you heard things

Bitch I know you heard things

Yeah, I know you heard things

Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this

I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city a way right now

So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now
"That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog."
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out

To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you

Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember? I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you

Remember? When you had to take the bar exam

You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then

But how 'bout now?

Cause I'm up right now, and you suck right now

Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then

I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit

You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"

You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losin' it

Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to

People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year

I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year

Guess I just had to pretend that year

Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Working Monday night, on the corner flipping hard
Made at least three thousand, on the Boulevard
I've been working graveyard, shifts every other weekend

Ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
I've been flipping in the house, making juugs on the highway

I've been riding out of state, making money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon have another drink

Put the world on our sound, you know PARTY and The Weeknd

Ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, "Bring the juice, we about to get lit"

Fill the room up with some tings, one night off and this is it
Always workin' OT, overtime and outta town
Shit is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep; shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle, I don't take them shits

But you do, so I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills, I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think how we had the club going up



Workin' Monday night, on the corner flippin' hard

Made at least 3 thousand, on the boulevard

I've been workin' graveyard shifts every other weekend

Ain't got no fuckin' time to party on the weekend

I've been flippin' in the house, makin' juugs on the highway

I've been ridin' out of state, makin' money like my way

I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon' have another drink

How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night

She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg

She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see

She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot

Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy

Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit

I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit

I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer

Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture

Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top

You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg

Damn, okay, from that perspective

I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that

Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at

But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all

But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on

These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em

Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough

I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'

PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'

Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense

Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Yea man TIP in this motherfucker with me nigga
(I count six shots)
Bustin' out the bando
A nigga jewelry real metal like a can opener
I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip
I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips
And the F&N make my hip limp
I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dimps
She gon' bring it on a big ship
Quite trill, no Quik Trip
I got drugs in the alley, know Tip there
She just wanna have a good day

Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A

Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up

If it ain't about the money

Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time

If it ain't about the money

Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit

If it ain't about the money

Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it
Turn it!
I pack an 11, I pack an 11, ooh
I ride in a gator, my shoes are Giuseppe, ooh
I'm S.L.I.M.E. like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend, aye
Pants out the grocery store, they stuffed with lettuce, aye
She try make the extras,
I told on these bitches, hey
When it's bout time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches, hey
Ay, what you think we in the neighborhood for?
Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough
I‚Äôll be damned if a nigga wife a hood ho
Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones"
Put your money down, I could buck a hard 4
You playin' with it, I'ma send 'em through your car door
My watch flooded, shit sick, got Parvo
I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo
The head honcho, nigga no Tonto, nigga
I'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga
Niggas talk shit, well I don't respond to no nigga

No murder, no dough, no convo nigga
Aye, what you think we in the neighborhood for?

Standin in the trap, slangin good blow
Maybach used to slang that crack
Buy a stolen car while he bang that AK
If you ever took a loss better bring that back
Catcha' witcha' betcha' heat will blow your brains bout
Know you better be, on your best behavior when addressing me

Because, bye-gones, we don't let em be

Niggas disrespect me, I'm a catch a felony
For real, if you listen I can get you paid

But not interested in shit you say
Ay, what you think we in the neighborhood for?
Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough
I‚Äôll be damned if a nigga wife a hood ho
Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones" nigga
All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'

They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore

They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand

Niggas we don't need anymore

All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops

Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'

The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'
She asked me

"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"

She asked me

"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"

I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment

Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
What are we even doing?
Ridin' clean

With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord

I've seen some things

I wish we had met when I was in my teens

Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord

Cause these days I only know conditional love

I'm not used to settlin' down

I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "you don't how good it is to be you cause you're him"
And I say "well, goddamn"
Then ask myself

Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?

Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?

I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment

Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

All of this, it‚Äôs alcohol, it‚Äôs drugs, weed, it‚Äôs everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need uh,uh, uh, uh to educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot



(Yeah, you‚Äôre right. You‚Äôre right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted‚Ä¶)



They know they‚Äôre too hot. They don‚Äôt give a fuck. It‚Äôs the Heat Of The Moment. It‚Äôs the Heat Of The Moment and that‚Äôs all it is. It‚Äôs The Heat Of The Moment



(I agree.)



This shit, that‚Äôs all it is. It‚Äôs the heat of the moment. Be a 100% woman, or try and be a 100% man, and use a fucking condom



(Haaa.)
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal,
 and a gold bezel
I treat it so special,
 now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter,
 I'm a go getter
Swae Lee, Lee Swae, it's the same difference
H2O, lean, same thing
Niggas throw sets and gang bang
Free everybody in the chain gang
Been two days since I laid down
Kool Moe Dee, five chains on
Mister T, them rings on, say my fucking name ho
Yeah, them diamonds so cool, yeah, that old school mine fool
Never heard about you,
 all my hoes, they so rude
Tats all on me nigga, trill ass individual
Don't check, I'm that nigga,
 sit on my Balmain zipper
Got a airtight schedule,
 fuck your bitch, just met her
Pink slip, no rental,
 got a L full of that killer
Beating on my chest, like Magilla
Nigga, I am the gorilla of the village
Pack sound like heavy metal
Just killed the haters, God bless them
Young niggas got to get to the money
Five chains on, they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, why you have so many condoms with you?

I said, I'm a player, to be honest with you
Hublot, whoo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money, when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple, on the red carpet
And I'm flyer, than a nigga on a hang glider
4-5-6-7 chains on,
 just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's?
 Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well known flexer,
 I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy

Three hoes freak dancing, on the loud singing acapella
Chain clang, like heavy metal
Sremm killed the haters, God bless them
Thugga, my money 8ft tall, two midgets aye
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)

I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)

See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)

Detroit vs. Everybody
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise

And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority

Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not

It's simple as the alphabet

F with me, that G shall surely see

He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture

The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester

We tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I

Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state

You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles an Aries coupe

Might as well ride by in an ambulance

My pair'll shoot like skydivin' in Hammer pants

So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like

Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free

(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block

All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?

(Welcome to Detroit, motherfucka)
Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety

100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion

Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'

I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see

I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand then the ball in the net

Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me

I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day

Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day

Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes

Now the stakes high,
niggas surprised at the new lines

Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years

I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat

Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty

Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya

Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ

Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller

In a blink I'll hit your kisser, have your ass not rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Had K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein‚Äôs son
Any niggas try to copy, put a hole in his top

It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world

Like it was before my life became a movie
And they usually use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refiller

Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal

It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery

And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited

But I made it to radio, eat a dick

I still never ABC the shit

Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller

Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit

And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here

Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler

Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage
You crazy for me to flip

What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson

When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid

On the track get spanked like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch

Sick of bein' treated like me and shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features

And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me

I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch

180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish

Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful ingeniousness, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this type of static in your life

When I'm makin' you cling to it

They consider tryin' to reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away

But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs

Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit

Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit

Is playin' with you
but ain't shit changing

And it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer

Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter

With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again

Or the Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent

Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger

Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?

And if they mention us
What up doe, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on

That means Detroit vs. Everybody!

Hey Em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood, let the little homies get this remix crackin'

Detroit!
I'll hold you down
I'm on my way
All you've been thinking about

Do anything you want and let emotion rule your mind (rule your mind)
And now you say you dream about doing it anyway

Oh yeah, just tell me where it's on your mind (on your mind)
Sit in my whip and see the stars (and see the stars)

(I'm the one that's gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)
I had some problems back home (so I heated up)
Maybe it's that Virginia in me (nigga say something)
Have a young nigga go so hard
Through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like a coward when he hit me
Get me? Girl I swear to God you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of ya'll for the real one and you know it
And I hold it down
I'mma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been servin'
Away from the realest nigga in it, I'mma take you away
And I hold you down, (I'mma hold you down)

I'mma hold you down baby
I'm the one gon' hold you down

Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town
Even when the roads is down, you mesmerized by the flying sky

We gotta socialize and cherish times

This shit is deeper than love
I pull up in that Lamborghini, the doors in the sky

Shit is straight up suicide
You in that new Bentley truck, new, new Bentley truck
We've been playing in that Versace
We go to Abu Dhabi for a hobby
Your body my new Bugatti
Live an expensive life and I'm just getting started
(real life)
Hold you down, hold you down
Hold you down like I'm supposed to

Five niggas, six niggas, I ain‚Äôt give a shit about shit, nigga

(Girl I see you)
Girl you must be doin' magic

Girl you must be doin' magic
Turn fuckin' you to a habit

Won‚Äôt do for you, I do for you
When I hit you at your condo real late

Check to see and see if you straight
Then cut like kids cake
I got that feelin' for you, that feelin' that you crave
Each time I do it for you, I make that bad pussy behave

Now pop it, bottles, the top is so open
The budget I'm Party so fuck it
The concierge told me my new baby looking like LeToya Luckett
Let my money get older and older and older and older like Regis
And she will not fuck with no broke niggas, no, nigga, only the richest
Yeah shout the girls from the east who know what's good with me

Shout the ones from the west know what's good with PND
Stories of you and your girls is all I hear
Who do you fuck in the city when I'm not there?
(I owe you time) let's plan somethin' out when I come back from Europe
Swear I'm withholdin' my urges 'til you get this one-on-one shit like your name Katie Couric
I gotta get you those snow tires for your Mercedes, I'm glad you reminded me baby
All of these things slip my mind it's been crazy
Bite on your shoulder I know that's your favorite

Touching yourself to that video we made a month ago

You a freak and your cover's blown
How you talked me into sendin' that to you, I'll never know
Fuck it girl, I'm 'bout whatever though

Yeah I guess a nigga just believe in you

And that's proof for you
Could name a lot of things any other man won't do for you

I'll do it for you, that's real
I'ma pull up, eat on that pussy and dip
I'ma keep one inside the chamber like Wilt
She gon' look over these bitches like terms and conditions
I'ma move her out the trenches and buy her a Bentley
I'ma pull on that wavy hair cause it's Indian Remy
She tied the knot so she can die with me
She say she can do the same thing as 5 bitches

So I went and fired them 5 bitches
Shawty got me fucked up, blowin' O's, no Audi
Not Young Scooter but all she know is count up
London On Da Track bitch

I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up

I guess drama makes for the best content

Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til your unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch

Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah I know that karma's too real so I hope you doin' cool

But still stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you

Little stupid ass I ain't fuckin with

I ain't fuckin', I ain't I ain't fuckin' with you

I ain't fuckin' with you
Yo! I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake

On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd m√©nage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody, but tape
Yeah, that was a setup, for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt's fake,
 worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5, is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet

Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky

Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July

Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only

Rich niggas only, independent bitches only

Boss niggas only, thick bitches only

I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man

But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach

I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video

You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt

But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key or maybe high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know

Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?

I mean, it doesn‚Äôt take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I‚Äôm obsessed with thick women and I agree

Yeah, that‚Äôs right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that‚Äôs cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up

So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, aye)
I never fucked Nic and that's fucked up

If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up

Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right

Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth

Then I make you burp boy,
treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses, with army guns
So think about, your son and daughter rooms

Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns

Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off

I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off

Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't

Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully,
with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"

To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"
Yah, bad bitches is the... yah

Bad bitches is the only thing that I like, woo
You ain't got no life, nah

I make my own money, so I spend it how I like, woo

I'm just living life, hey, hey

And let my momma tell it, nigga, I ain't living right, yup
Chop the top off the Porsche, that's a headless horse
Extendo long as an extension cord
Bitch, I ball like Jordan and I play full court
And if you not my type

Then you know I got to keep this shit short
Why you wanna go flex? Like you all in the mix

Like you got some shit popping off
I got some models that you see up in the movies

And they want to make a flick for the camera

Wanna be Kim Kardashian, heard I was living like a bachelor
Spend it how I like, yah, sinning every night, yah
Push start the whip, hey, brought it straight to life, for life
Blowing on the kush, blowing, 'til I'm out of sight, I'm gone
I don't check the price, bitch, all I do is swipe, woo
She said, what's your type? Yah, I said, I like what I like, yah
I don't second guess, nah, I just roll the dice, keep it moving
Keep your two cents, hey, take your own advice, hey
I've been living life, yeah, like I live twice
I don't got no type, I don't got no type
And let my momma tell it, nigga, I ain't living right
Rrrr Ting

I'll admit it, I'll admit it

You haven't been a man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business

Rolling swishers hittin' swishes

Got me feelin' like a ball hog

I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it

You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it

She'll admit it, she'll admit it

She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life

You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6 boy

Shit hot up in the 6 right now shit hot up in the 6 boy

Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed boy

Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys
I give a fuck about old boy

I give a fuck about your mob boy
I'm the real 6 God boy
I'm about to say a true thing

I'm about to say a true thing
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain

God damn you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things

I know you heard things

Bitch I know you heard things

Yeah, I know you heard things

Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this

I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city a way right now

So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now
"That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog."
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out

To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you

Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember? I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you

Remember? When you had to take the bar exam

I drove in the snow for you

You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then

But how 'bout now?

Cause I'm up right now, and you suck right now

Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then

Girl how 'bout now?

Cause I'm up right now, and you suck right now, yeah

You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl

How 'bout now? Yeah

Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?

My heart belongs to you
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel

I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music

I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit

You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"

You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losin' it

Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that

Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to

People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year

I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year

Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
My hearts belongs to you

And I ain't signin' to no label, bitch I'm independent
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Working Monday night, on the corner flipping hard
Made at least three thousand, on the Boulevard
I've been working graveyard, shifts every other weekend

Ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
I've been flipping in the house, making juugs on the highway

I've been riding out of state, making money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon have another drink

I'm doing my stance, you know my Molly pink
I've got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn about what she think
It ain't no way no how

I made it on my own, I made my own style

I don't think that I should stay, you know I gotta go

You moving too fast, don't want to take it slow

Club goin' up, on a Tuesday

I just did 3 in a row, them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound, you know PARTY and The Weeknd

Ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, "Bring the juice, we about to get lit"

Fill the room up with some tings, one night off and this is it
Always workin' OT, overtime and outta town
Shit is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep; shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle, I don't take them shits

But you do, so I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills, I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think how we had the club going up



Workin' Monday night, on the corner flippin' hard

Made at least 3 thousand, on the boulevard

I've been workin' graveyard shifts every other weekend

Ain't got no fuckin' time to party on the weekend

I've been flippin' in the house, makin' juugs on the highway

I've been ridin' out of state, makin' money like my way

I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon' have another drink

I'm doin' my stance, you know my molly pink

I got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink

My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn 'bout what she think



[Hook] x4



And It ain't no way no, how I made it on my own

You know I gotta' go, you're moving too fast

Don't wanna take it slow



[Hook] x4

How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night

She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg

She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see

She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot

Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy

Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit

I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer

Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture

Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger

Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?

I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up

Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up

That's why I never ask for help

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top

You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg

Damn, okay, from that perspective

I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that

Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at

But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all

But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on

These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em

Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough

I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'

PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'

Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense

Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Yea man TIP in this motherfucker with me nigga
(I count six shots)
Bustin' out the bando
A nigga jewelry real metal like a can opener
I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip
I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips
And the F&N make my hip limp
I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dimps
She gon' bring it on a big ship
Quite trill, no Quik Trip

She just wanna have a good day

Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A

Ay, what you think we in the neighborhood for?
Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough

Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones"
Put your money down, I could buck a hard 4
You playin' with it, I'ma send 'em through your car door
My watch flooded, shit sick, got Parvo
I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo
The head honcho, nigga no Tonto, nigga
I'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga
Niggas talk shit, well I don't respond to no nigga

No murder, no dough, no convo nigga
Aye, what you think we in the neighborhood for?

Standin in the trap, slangin good blow
Maybach used to slang that crack
Buy a stolen car while he bang that AK
If you ever took a loss better bring that back
Catcha' witcha' betcha' heat will blow your brains bout
Know you better be, on your best behavior when addressing me

Because, bye-gones, we don't let em be

Niggas disrespect me, I'm a catch a felony
For real, if you listen I can get you paid

But not interested in shit you say
Ay, what you think we in the neighborhood for?
Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough
I‚Äôll be damned if a nigga wife a hood ho
Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones" nigga
All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'

They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore

They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand

Niggas we don't need anymore

All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops

Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'

The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'
She asked me

"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"

She asked me

"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"

I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment

Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
What are we even doing?
Ridin' clean

With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord

I've seen some things

I wish we had met when I was in my teens

Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord

Cause these days I only know conditional love

I'm not used to settlin' down

I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "you don't how good it is to be you cause you're him"
And I say "well, goddamn"
Then ask myself

Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?

Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?

I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment

Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

All of this, it‚Äôs alcohol, it‚Äôs drugs, weed, it‚Äôs everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need uh,uh, uh, uh to educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot

They know they‚Äôre too hot. They don‚Äôt give a fuck. It‚Äôs the Heat Of The Moment. It‚Äôs the Heat Of The Moment and that‚Äôs all it is. It‚Äôs The Heat Of The Moment



(I agree.)



This shit, that‚Äôs all it is. It‚Äôs the heat of the moment. Be a 100% woman, or try and be a 100% man, and use a fucking condom

Hublot, whoo, so shiny

See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)

Detroit vs. Everybody
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise

And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority

Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not

It's simple as the alphabet

F with me, that G shall surely see

He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture

The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester

We tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I

Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state

You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles an Aries coupe

Might as well ride by in an ambulance

My pair'll shoot like skydivin' in Hammer pants

So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like

Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free

(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block

All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?

(Welcome to Detroit, motherfucka)
Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety

100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion

Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'

I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see

I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand then the ball in the net

Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me

I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day

Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day

Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes

Now the stakes high,
niggas surprised at the new lines

Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years

I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat

Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty

Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya

Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ

Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller

In a blink I'll hit your kisser, have your ass not rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Had K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein‚Äôs son
Any niggas try to copy, put a hole in his top

It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world

Like it was before my life became a movie
And they usually use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refiller

Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal

It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery

And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited

But I made it to radio, eat a dick

I still never ABC the shit

Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller

Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit

And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here

Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler

Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage
You crazy for me to flip

What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson

When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid

On the track get spanked like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch

Sick of bein' treated like me and shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features

And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me

I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch

180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish

Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful ingeniousness, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this type of static in your life

When I'm makin' you cling to it

They consider tryin' to reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away

But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs

Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit

Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit

Is playin' with you
but ain't shit changing

And it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer

Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter

With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again

Or the Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent

Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger

Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?

And if they mention us
What up doe, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on

That means Detroit vs. Everybody!

Hey Em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood, let the little homies get this remix crackin'

Detroit!
I'll hold you down
I'm on my way
All you've been thinking about

Do anything you want and let emotion rule your mind (rule your mind)
And now you say you dream about doing it anyway

Oh yeah, just tell me where it's on your mind (on your mind)
Sit in my whip and see the stars (and see the stars)
I'll hold you down
(I'm the one gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)
I'm on my way

(I'm the one be rolling up in that Bentley truck cause I'm old enough)

Want you here right now

(You the one that got all I need, give me all of you or all of me)

I'm on my way
(I'm the one that's gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)
I had some problems back home (so I heated up)
Maybe it's that Virginia in me (nigga say something)
Have a young nigga go so hard
Through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like a coward when he hit me
Get me? Girl I swear to God you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of ya'll for the real one and you know it
And I hold it down
I'mma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been servin'
Away from the realest nigga in it, I'mma take you away
And I hold you down, (I'mma hold you down)

I'mma hold you down baby
I'm the one gon' hold you down

Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town
Even when the roads is down, you mesmerized by the flying sky

We gotta socialize and cherish times

This shit is deeper than love
I pull up in that Lamborghini, the doors in the sky

Shit is straight up suicide
You in that new Bentley truck, new, new Bentley truck
We've been playing in that Versace
We go to Abu Dhabi for a hobby
Your body my new Bugatti
Live an expensive life and I'm just getting started
(real life)
Hold you down, hold you down
Hold you down like I'm supposed to
God damn, boy, that nigga Mac didn't never call, bruh

But I'm seeing that nigga everywhere, bruh

Dog, you know they say nigga went Hollywood and shit

Fuck that nigga, dog, OGG, fuck is a OGG? OGG, OGG, aye, bruh

I mean, you don't think that nigga really getting no money, right?

I mean, he ain't really fucking hoes, right? Well, damn
Bitch, you guessed it

Hwah, you was right

Bitch, you guessed it
Grah-grah, fuck nigga on sight
Bitch, you guessed it

Still in that place and I'm flexin'

Hwah, bitch, you guessed it
I'm still with my niggas, come and test us,
 OGG
Bitch you guessed it,
 walkin' around with extra in my pocket
Bitch, you next to us, why the fuck are you next to us?
Bitch, you should come test us
I seen what you rockin' and bitch you can't dress with us
Seen what yo bitch looked like

And nigga I wasn't impressed or nothin'
What the fuck we finna talk about

All we know is that Mula, Benjis, Franklins and that Guala

Fetti with us,
 bunch of young niggas
Bunch of them bitches all in they whip, lickin' on titties
Runnin' my check up, I think I'm with Nike, I'm sprinting
Sheesh, y'all couldn't hear me
Bitch, you guessed it, you was motherfucking right
Gotta get real again, gotta get real again
No, you got niggas and I got bitches

You got niggas and I got bitches

You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas, I want you
I want you, to turn up on me, every night when I see you
Better recognize when I see you
I really want you, you, you, hit the club for you, you, you
Lightskin got you new, new, do, even look like Lauren London too
I be tripping, but this money ain't

Hit the strip, check my money length
Sorry if my whip covered in dank

Cause I've been rollin' with this skunk all day
All these bitches know that you're my nigga
I ain‚Äôt trippin' off of any of your niggas

Cause I don't care about your nigga, four niggas

Five niggas, six niggas, I ain‚Äôt give a shit about shit, nigga

(Girl I see you)
Girl you must be doin' magic

Girl you must be doin' magic
Turn fuckin' you to a habit
I could name a lot of things any other man

Won‚Äôt do for you, I do for you
When I hit you at your condo real late

Check to see and see if you straight
Then cut like kids cake
I got that feelin' for you, that feelin' that you crave
Each time I do it for you, I make that bad pussy behave

Now pop it, bottles, the top is so open
The budget I'm Party so fuck it
The concierge told me my new baby looking like LeToya Luckett
Let my money get older and older and older and older like Regis
And she will not fuck with no broke niggas, no, nigga, only the richest
Yeah shout the girls from the east who know what's good with me

Shout the ones from the west know what's good with PND
Stories of you and your girls is all I hear
Who do you fuck in the city when I'm not there?
(I owe you time) let's plan somethin' out when I come back from Europe
Swear I'm withholdin' my urges 'til you get this one-on-one shit like your name Katie Couric
I gotta get you those snow tires for your Mercedes, I'm glad you reminded me baby
All of these things slip my mind it's been crazy
Bite on your shoulder I know that's your favorite

Touching yourself to that video we made a month ago

You a freak and your cover's blown
How you talked me into sendin' that to you, I'll never know
Fuck it girl, I'm 'bout whatever though

Yeah I guess a nigga just believe in you

And that's proof for you
Could name a lot of things any other man won't do for you

I'll do it for you, that's real
I'ma pull up, eat on that pussy and dip
I'ma keep one inside the chamber like Wilt
She gon' look over these bitches like terms and conditions
I'ma move her out the trenches and buy her a Bentley
I'ma pull on that wavy hair cause it's Indian Remy
She tied the knot so she can die with me
She say she can do the same thing as 5 bitches

So I went and fired them 5 bitches
Shawty got me fucked up, blowin' O's, no Audi
Not Young Scooter but all she know is count up

"We got a young brother that stands for something! We got a young brother that believes in the all of us! Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author! And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that ‚Äî right on! ‚Äî I said, you can't do that without loving yourself first."
This is a world premiere!
I done been through a whole lot

Trial, tribulation, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow tie

Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me

So many motherfuckers wanna down me

But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And I love myself

(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)

I love myself

(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)

I love myself

(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)

I love myself

(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)

What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)

Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)

Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart

On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company

What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence

How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this
They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street

And a gun in the hood and a mob of police

And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiend

And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace

Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)

Down, down valley deep (Down, down valley deep)

Fi-fie-fo-fum (Fi-fie-fo-fum)

My heart undone (My heart undone)
I went to war last night

With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic

I'ma do it till I get it right
I went to war last night

I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me

And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"
I lost my head

I must misread what the good book said
Oh woes be me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again till the well runs dry (i)
Fuck niggas gon' multiply

'Fore the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply

'Fore the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply

Fuck niggas won't multiply, fuck niggas won't multiply
Igh, igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
Yeah nigga, it's your boy Juicy J
Man, you gotta watch out for these old backstabbin', broke ass, you know what I'm sayin'? Jealous hatin' ass niggas out here man, you know what I'm sayin'?

Man these niggas ain't no real niggas man, know what I'm sayin'?
Man these niggas be smilin' in your face
Back in the buildin', sold crack in the livin' room
Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a livin'
Doo rag, keep a red or blue flag in the denim
One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers don't sleep, take cat naps
Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad back, bad back
Even in my will, keep it real, thuggin' in my field

'Til the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel
Youngins trained to kill, aimin', bangin' steel and slangin' krill
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill

Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots

But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed

Reason why you niggas wearin' gold

Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose
I remember, if Pimp was alive he'd tell these hoes and these niggas
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel

Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel

Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel

Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I...
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply

When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply

When all the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply

But if the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply
I'm the original Balmain badass, nigga
I'm the original Margiela madman, in the words of A$AP Yams
Smack the shit out a nigga in these skinny pants, feel me?
Don't get it fucked up, nigga, we been jiggy, been pretty
Still tell a bitch suck my dick, swag swag nigga
Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
Shit, I might fuck around and bring the Jeep back

No doors on it, flexin' with the seat back
B-Boy with the G pack,
 might fuck around and bring the mink back

Word to Big Boi and 3 Stacks, nigga
If you deaf bring the beat back, nigga
Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
I'm a trend setter, you ain't even peep that
Where the hoes, where the weed, where the cheese at?
Fuck the FCC, tell 'em bleep that
(We ain't no fashion killas nigga, we fashionable killas

Ya'll got Flacko)
3, 6, suck a nigga dick no foreplay
All day, boomin' out the trap through the hallway
Slow up, Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been

You can freshen our minds,
On the style, gettin' styled 9 times out of 10
I'm the motherfuckin' Lord of this fashion shit

Don't I deserve just to brag a bit?
Set the blueprint, fuck your two cents
Number 1 stunner, ask Tumblr if I'm accurate
My motherfuckin' swag is immaculate
Plus I got enough style just to mack your bitch
I think back to when pockets packin lint
It's like a nigga got rich on accident
Now back to Pimp
Bitches lie, killers never lie
Triggers on the side by side, bet I'm down to ride
Prosper said let's ride to the sky, call it catastrophic
We don't ever die, we just multiply, bitch
Fake ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin', these niggas be out here talkin' 'bout they a street nigga and shit, man niggas be gettin' extorted like a mothafucka out here man, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm in love with the coco

I'm in love with the coco

I got it for the low, low

I'm in love with the coco
Hit my plug, that's my cholo

Cause he got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco

Hit you with that treinta ocho
Niggas thinkin' that I'm solo

50 deep, they're like, "oh, no" (No, no, no, please, no)
Heard the feds takin' photos

I know nothin', fuck the popo
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda

Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda

Whip it through the glass, nigga

I'm blowin' money fast, nigga
36, that's a kilo

Need a brick, miss my free throw
I'm in love, just like Ne-Yo
Bustin' shots, now he Neo
Free my homies, fuck the C.O

Fuck the judge, fuck my P.O
All this coke, like I'm Nino
Water whip, like I'm Nemo
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real

Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag,
and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

(Look at her butt)

Look at, look at, look at

Look, at her butt
This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles

Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag,
Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...

Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway?

Clich√©, clich√©, clich√©, clich√©

Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway?

Clich√©, clich√©, clich√©, clich√©
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah?
And the missing love that's misunderstood, yeah?
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clich√©s in a dark past
Toast to clich√©s in a dark past
Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
Girl get to bustin' before the cops come running
Chuck the deuces,
chuck the D'usse
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say
I don't care if we on the run

Baby as long I'm next to you

And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in you
I hear sirens while we make love

Loud as hell, but they don't know

They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo

I know it's crazy but
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tatts, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off,
if things ring off

My nails get dirty,
my past ain't pretty

My lady is,
my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100,
hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know it's 'til the death,
I hope it's obvi to niggas
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'mma wave this Tec,
I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at
I click clack
Push your mothafuckin' wig back, I did that

I been wilding since a juvi,
she was a good girl

'til she knew me,
now she is in the drop bustin' Uey's, screaming
Deeper then words,
beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life

Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on,
police in sight

Oh, what a beautiful death,
let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell

Just sneak out and meet me,
bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world,
then so be it
I don't care if they give me life

I get all of my life from you

And if loving you had a price

I would pay my life for you
I don't care I'll never give it up

Give it up, give it up, give it all away

No I swear I'll never give it up

Give it up, give it up, give it all away

I don't care I'll never give it up

Give it up, give it up, give it all away

No I swear I'll never give it up

Give it up, give it up, give it all away

(Without you I got nothing to lose)
My name is KXNG CROOKED,
I snap on you rappers often

When I'm spazzin' I'm just gettin' my passionate point across

Like a hood cat clappin' his hands when he's talkin'

Now that I got your attention, I feel I should really mention
Don't come around here flossin', Big Willies, we really lynch 'em
Pull out the chopper, rappers hittin' the ground

Like every bar is a bullet, when I pull it, it sound like

B-b-b-b-b a couple of bullets are comin' your way then it jam

Like god damn

Then I pick up somethin' quicker, start killin' everything in the vicinity
The proximity, the Glocksimity, we on Yosemite Sam
Bam, bam your body drop

Van Damme, karate chop
The Beretta's a better competitor

Pop pop turn your sweater to a crop top

Killin' you and whoever in that drop top

Etcetera, etcetera and it will not stop
Just shoot, shoot like doot doot

And beaucoup, beaucoup, I'm cuckoo
I'm a star goin' to war with you clones like Count Dooku
I'm worlds apart from you rappers

Like I walk in the booth rockin' a biosuit made of plastic
And NASA's galactic elastic travelin' through space, interstellar rapping

Broadcastin' from uninhibited planets
You see a flash in the sky, it's that nigga, I

When I land, you wack niggas die

And your casket is your last hit
You wack bitch, fuckin' bastard
Back to the hand clappin'
You die quicker than Darren Wilson walkin' through Ferguson

Dressed like the grand dragon of the Klan

Passin' niggas with pants saggin'

With their hand on a black Magnum
To clap him backwards

So their last words is "kcuf meth nmad saggin"

That's backwards for "fuck them damn niggas"
Buck them damn triggers

Charge us, bodies fill up them damn Rivers

Cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive

But I only like dead rappers

Compare me to the best rappers who died
And you rappers I used to look up to

I gotta cancel you now

Like Simon Cowell, I can't let you ex factors survive
Nah, the time's right and they finally limelightin' the god of this rhyme writin'
My mic can only be likened to Poseidon's trident and Zeus' lightin' strike
And my metaphors are what Thor was to the Norse viking
I'm a born titan and at-point kill 'em like swordfightin'
I'm slicin' organs with songwritin', I dwarf giants
I hope I'm rubbin' you pussies wrong sort of like poor dykin'
I smoke philosophy, I snort science

That means I'm higher than higher learnin', look in my eyes
I am on my get rich or die tryin' like when Em was signin' Curtis

Cause I am murderous
(Joe Budden, Jersey City, New Jersey)
Now we can do this a couple of different ways, it really depends

Could give them classic NY jeans over the Timbs

Or I could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims
I could tell you why I'm hot and disappear like MIMS
But the bars there, put that on God, ask an atheist
And if I ain't the bomb at least I'm in the blast radius
I'm beating these kids' indictment, shit, I like the terror
APB on my actions, I'm in the viking era
Moment of truth, I give you facts right now

Fuck this cypher, my mind ain't on rap right now

So it's fuck metaphors and punches, all the witty shit
Got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip

Face says I been stressed

I got an aunt getting her ass kicked by MS
Nigga, why am I here? For the look, for the promo
Cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfather's heart
Yeah, but not the side that the beat is on
I'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on
I'm planning the funeral, I'm getting the hearse ready

These niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready

Not a how do I feel, not a how do I deal
If that's the life, nigga, then how is it real?
These last couple of days I've been speaking to my peers

Giving them cries for help, I guess they need to see the tears
wildest part of all of that is

They'll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge
But fuck it, gotta pardon 'em, shout out to my squad and 'em
House Gang,
Yelawolf, Gadsden, Alabama
My name is Wayne, I'm from Alabama

Here's the back story
I just fell off the turnip truck with Ernest Tubb
I'm 33, I've got 3 kids and I just popped 3 pills

I don't know which one's which or what it's for

Safety ain't really a habit I've formed
I still smoke to the cigarette butt

I still drink till I end up being that klutz

Clumsy, self-destructive dummy
Stumbling over my words, mumbling
And pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars

And dream about that light that leads up to the lord
I have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard
Wake up feeling like half a human
Hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret
For my lack of union between rap, you and the rock and roll community
For unity between country music and MCs, I'm claiming immunity
Still I'm working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way Charlemagne the god and Lord Jamar thought it would be
Wait a minute... the lord and the god hate me

Jesus Christ, I am the white devil!
I'm still working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way I thought it should be
I've got floor-to-ceiling windows and a cabin-style mansion

Books, bears, trucks, boats, tires, spares, four-wheelers

Three-wheelers, two-wheelers, a drug dealer on call

Plaques on the wall, racks on the wall for my guns on the wall
Lift kits,
low riders
chop shops
hi tops
low tops
Dixie flags
Slumerican tags on my Slumerican ass

CEO
Guess who's coming to dinner?

Andr√© 3000 and Hank the Third, go figure
M-80s
Moonshine
gold watches, gold rings

All fake, no bling, don't hate, that's my thing
I've got new clothes, old clothes, vintage, tremendous, endless style

Goodwill loves me Mackle-more than you
with skate videos on repeat
and Beats by Dre

Thank you very much, Jimmy Iovine for the check
I've got a black woman fine as she can be

FeFe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind
Don't look under the tarp, sir
And I did it my way

See, hip hop is what you make of it
And I'm makin' a lot of it
See that's a quadruple entendre, Jay Z eat your heart out
But these cyphers, I treat 'em like a war, don't want no mediators
Nah, this that grow up in the P's behavior, next door to the greasy neighbors
I was someone who never needed favors to get where I'm at
I'm opposite the hands of Sandusky

With the shit that my pen state, these rappers can't touch me
As a younger dude, life was somethin' rude

I barely made it to the first like a Cutler move
Did I say 3 in 1? That's funny cause there's 4 of us in the Slaughter

That's a 3 and 1, I learned that in public school too

Like what's in between a 3 and 1 and House Gang, I spoke to all 3 on 1 call
Like I dropped 2 albums and #3 is 1 second from bein' done
Just need y'all 3 to send me 1 verse apiece
For this Heatmakerz beat and Brother's Keeper 1
Simple mathematics,
I'm addin' up to all these rap addicts
I don't like to divide dough so I multiply flow

And subtract maggots
Like a brand new Craftmatic, boy I'm back at it
Smokin' these new boys like my last habit

Dabnabbit I tried to quit but everything I kick's like the last dragon
Hoes suckin' my drummer dick, they on my bandwagon
I just gotta laugh cause y'all pushin' a lot of swag
If I don't got no business there, I don't got no business there
See there's a difference here

You hustlin' so you can be seen

Nigga I'm grindin' so I can disappear
When it's on time, it's skull and bone signs at the stu
We got guns you only find on your cheat code screen
If you think I remind you of any of these niggas you wildin' out

Like Chico Bean
When there's drama I don't ask no questions, I just clap in that direction
I look at this gat like it's an actual accessory
Nigga I shoot the breeze with actual weaponry
Last person I had a bond with was a bail bondsman
Now imagine me hangin' with y'all and we rappin' on the same song

Nigga I'd rather juggle a couple of chainsaws
Or run through hell with a pair of gasoline Hanes on
I'm a star but not on some I wanna be a star kinda shit
The only celebrity that give a fuck less than me is Marshawn Lynch
Glock in the stash as a backup but the MAC'll burst
Cripple your style, your first born child'll come out

With a colostomy bag as the afterbirth
I don't give a fuck
Nigga I'll show up to Beyonce's show posin' as Jay Z
Stagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest

Lookin' like Omarion holdin' his baby
Drinkin' and sniffin' enough blow that it got me thinkin' I can exchange sicknesses

Maybe, this ebola for rabies
lookin' like it's 'bout to start singin' it's MAC tonight
Cause shit can turn into that song except I don't give a fuck what day it is

I'll have this club goin' up, fuck with me
Slap this clip in this gat then call this arm Christy Mack

Cause this bitch is that war machine
Life of a giant, but who needs size when you're wack and your team's soft
Drag your girl down this hill 'til she admits that it feels like she's jackin' the beanstalk
We both got marketing plans

Yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before

Mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me
Rolled up with the Smith & Wesson and drew on you like let's fight now
I do numbers,
I turn you and your crew into two plumbers
Translation, get your shit together and pipe down
Fuck a mic, I don't write, I chew and spit
Silencer's so big it look like I got Bobby Shmurda tied to the barrel
And he doin' this
(My name is Marshall

I'm repping that motherfucking Motor City, bitch)
I just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet
Began to trend-set,
murdered a friend's pet
Made shit as ill as it can get went in depth

Like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet
I'm already covered in sweat

And I wasn't even ready to come in yet
AHH, let me set this drink down
Beat up a gal, start beef with her pal
Probably be wild 'til I'm wrinkled and senile
And "Rap God" was a freestyle

Off the top of the dome piece while I was sleep on the couch
And I'm freestyling now
my cerebral is foul

Cause shit I'm thinking about should be illegal
I need my head banned
like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio

And went to South Beach with his talents
Scream "fuck you" on the way out and wink with a smile
This whole game can eat a dick, I'm going back deep underground

But right now I'm back on that bullshit and you I'm singling out

Cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while
What the fuck is this clusterfuck of busters
Bunch of Buster Douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders
One swing and you're crowned

Knocked one out the park,
one catchy jingle and now

You think you fucking with me cause you sold like 300 thou
Bitch, I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground
Reach up, swing from a cloud
with 3 thousand people around
Evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd

And heave a child in a sink hole on Cinco De Mayo

When I'm sprinkled in pico de gallo
Mardi Gras beads in a towel
I just made that up
I don't know much Spanish, I'm not bilingual
But I'll show you a Mexican stand off

Between just these two amigos

Cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud

But I sure as fuck think I know how read body English, no doubt
Cause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically

The fuck is humility? What is a real emcee?

Royce, he came up in the shit with me
Never spit that hustler shit, it wasn't a fit for me
Let them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me

Just not giving a fuck and plus with the history

Of muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery

Why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning
So what in the fuck is a list to me?

I'm used to not being on it, I expect it out 'em
Heck wit' em, I get my respect without 'em
Ain't really been into diamonds since I put my first record out

But I could put a chain around my second album

And wear it as a neck medallion
Became a millionaire, went downhill from there
Became civil,
office swivel chair, sterling silverware

Screaming life is still unfair til I get a real career
This job is too fulfilling
Two ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in
And a mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville

Into some children at the food pavilion and Build-A-Bear
Warrior's mind,
I‚Äôm pro-hydrocodone euphoria

In the Drug Emporium line, I'm soaring
I'm pouring Vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on 'em fore I go four wheeler riding
Gory and violent and horrifying
But I finger her like a witness, show me a line-up
I guess I must've threw you for a loop like toucan Sam
When I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam
You're playing right in Lex Luthor's hands

It's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan

But fuck it, Superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for Stan
I'm a brand new being like Grand Puba's band
Happy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed

In his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... I can't
Since honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try

Try to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify

As a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride

And say that I'm sorry, sorry I can't apologize
I think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines

And thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds
But I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke

It's more of a knockout than Janay Rice
Play nice, bitch, I punch Lana Del Rey right

In the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight
In plain sight of the elevator surveillance

Til her head is banged on the railing
Then celebrate with the Ravens
Never date an assailant that self-medicates with inhalants
I'd meditate, but I may need a better way to escape

The aggression, rage and the anger
Heavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains

This ain't enough to contain it
But I still get the same respect as Jay if I came on

Stage in a fucking negligee everyday and Liz Claiborne
Cause makeup ain't gonna cover

That eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut
Peppersprayed with your face cut
Made my bank like a lay up
Oh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent

It's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches

Yes, I said seven, I measured it

Seven inches from the floor

While I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony

At the Sheradon when I'm stretching it
Bitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get
Hella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon

When I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench
Existential detriments to a lesbian devil

In the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level
That separatists like a Chechnian rebel
Impressionist with a pencil
The edge of this Red Bull
Pedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever
You see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass
SHADYXV
The last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse
When I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird
When I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears
And these little Disney queers

Who use chicks for beards?

Just made that up too...
Oh and the Shady 2.0
We wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls
Cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes
The flows lose you as usual, so juvenile

2 year old when I go to the studio
You don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though

In my homie's Buick
Been known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it
When I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do

And I murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart
In one take, if I fuck up and I don't redo it
You couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it
The day I don't say fuck you all, you can throw me through it
Rootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip
With the sentiments, Eminem isn't penning them for the women

I'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot

But they consider me equivalent to chlamydia

They tryna get rid of me gadzooks
But I stiggity stand for the fliggity flag
Of the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through
And if I catch you doing anything

Hindering or prohibiting that after I give me that

Tattoo of your lips on my ass I'mma be literally

Pickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you WOOOOH!
Fuck it
Got it somewhere in there probably
If you leave this time I fear that you'll be gone for good

So I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and

He said he'll be back with that same

Tone that you just said you'll stay forever with
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling

I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do

All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
It seems that you're the only reason for it
I've been bleeding in your silence

I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in Fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God

He must be mad with me, it's coming
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with
So the iceberg never broke

And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it

And I poke (and I poke) and I poked at it
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more (some more)
And in my notepad, man I wrote (man I wrote)
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it

If it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last

I'mma hope (I'mma hope) so iceberg don't float (don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit

It'd be grandiose,
it's ten Grammies or my granite still standing

With a note (with a note) that read ''granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (the most)

One day it'll make you grow (you grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners

To God you shall consult (consult)
When the bright cameras are still cramming

In your face and it provoke (provoke)

You to act mannish, just stay planted

Cause you reaping what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and (and)

Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (and)

When you get mad and when you poke at it

When you poke it at just know, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision

Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck you would do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em lord?

(Do you hear 'em lord? Do you hear 'em?)
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live even when remorse that I give
When it gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive

When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me

Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance

Something's wrong, I can feel it 
(For six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I got, like something's about to happen but I don't know what

If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble

And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
(You are just what the doc ordered)
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
They said I rap like a robot, so call me  rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes

I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office

With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his, nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap

Packin' a mack in the back of the Ac
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack

And at the exact same time

I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motha-fuckin' table

Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic

I was under Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow?

All I do is drop F-bombs

Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece (yeah)
Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's

Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (Pew)
MC's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"

Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac

N.W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up

Blow up and be in a position

To meet Run DMC

And induct them into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n

Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game,
'til I walk a flock of flames

Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay-lookin boy

So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, lookin' boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur

Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy

You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy

Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
I'ma work for

Everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keeping up

With the same pace, looking boy
Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
this planet's Krypton
No Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin,
you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead

But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me

My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere

In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to

Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines

Just in case cause even you unsigned

Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground

But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine

Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line

I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP 1

When I tried to say

"I'll take seven kids from Columbine

Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"

See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal

Coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking

Cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

Just to come and shoot ya,
like when Fabolous made Ray J mad

Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad

Singing to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel

So Ray J went straight to the radio station

The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma,
you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating

How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream"

Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop"

Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it
With rock,
shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that

I don't know what words to use"
Let me know when it occurs to you

While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you

It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to

Prove that if you were half as nice

Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh, school flunky,
pill junky
But look at the accolades, these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek,
fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel

I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz

Still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling

Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic

To the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it

Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women

How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan

It's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation

To trip abroad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not

Why be a king when you can be a God?
Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'mma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man

The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone
Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup,
 driving through the sticks
Who the bitch riding with me?

Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated

But finally getting cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it

Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest

Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothing at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God,
 but it's hard, but it's hard
God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho

Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out
and I got 'em all wondering how, so

On the down low, haters drown slow

On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right

Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?

I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut

That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be asking us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up

Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken

Tell 'em jealous Judas is who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch I'm still the same
Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name

Chasing fame, chasing glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury
(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been working hard, I been searching for God

I been working hard, I been searching for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you

But I insist you call me back cause I miss you

I wish you well, well, I wish you would call

Cause lately it feel like I‚Äôm just not your sister at all, all
I‚Äôm sorry for calling and bawling, I‚Äôm all in

And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me

Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I‚Äôm me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel

Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser

So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
As as for [?] he left and he ain't coming back

I hate the man, if I see him I swear I tell him that

No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting, selling that

He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been working hard, I been searching for God

I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me

And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother

How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya

Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination

To parish by the Eiffel,
come now, please don't be spiteful

Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way I say how I'm your dad

It gets me thinking of incredible moments we've had
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you

But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend

Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there

And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care

Of anything I need, of your family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?

Would you stand with me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?

I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*

I've been feeling under pressure
Hey, what's up, bro? I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy.
Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that.
I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know.
cause you know we all talk to Debbie
You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it
Swag RattPack all day, boy.
Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant

Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent

I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it

I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl

It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss

Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors

I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior

Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?

Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul

Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now

I heard that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?

I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth

I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need

Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed

This is everything I love, everything I need

Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting.
A friend of mine was celebrating four years
you weren't able to answer
or whatever.
Anyway, the whole family, even the ones you don't know, my sister,s and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you.
Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know.
And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati
I love you, son, bye
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes

They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe

You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat

Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it

You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'

Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating

Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along

I'mma ask on the song
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace

But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend

What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em

If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?

I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me

I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't 
, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along

I'mma ask on the song
So, does she know I've been in that bed before?

A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl

Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself
(Now it's time for our wrap up
Let's give it everything we've got

Ready? Begin)
Artificial amateurs, aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat

Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats, got their canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily
Don Dada
Eating other editors with each and every energetic epileptic episode
Elevated etiquette
Furious
fat
fabulous, fantastic
Gift got great, global goods gone glorious
Gettin' godly in this game with the goriest
hear 'em holler at your homeboy
Imitators idolize
In an instant, I'll rise in an irate state
Juiced on my jams like Jheri curls
jocking joints
Justly, it's just me, writing my journals
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery
My mind makes marvelous movies,
masses

Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowing I'm nice,
make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off, not optional
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's
Quannum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got
Really raw raps,
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique, untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice lord victorious valid
weeded up on my workshift
Xerox my X-radiation holes extra large

X-height letters and xylophone tones
Yellow-back,
Yesterday's lawn yardsale, I yawn
Zig-Zag zombies, zooming to the zenith
(Good... can you say it faster?)
If Pirus and Crips all got along

They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me

Every time I'm in the street I hear
"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!"
"Man down,
where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"

"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was Me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG, Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans,
hope euphoria can slow dance

With society
, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out

At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out

Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it

But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine,
Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine,
we adapt to crime

Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch,
a wall of bullets coming from

AK's, AR's,
"Aye y'all, duck"

That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose

You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news

Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except

When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec

Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess,
m.A.A.d city
Wake your punk ass up! It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street. It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. How we do
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash

Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him

Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired cause I was inspired by all of my friends

To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana

And they wonder why I rarely smoke now

Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth

I was straight tweaking the next weekend,
we broke even

I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding

You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick A.K.A. Compton's human sacrifice
G-yeah, cocaine, weed.
Niggas been mixing shit since the 80's, loc.
Sherm sticks,
butt nakeds.
Dip, make a nigga flip.
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit.
One time's crooked and shit.
Block a nigga in.
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of I.V.s with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grands where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?

Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street

With a basketball
and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?

And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep

With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor,
instead of boy with a chopper

That hold the cul-de-sac hostage,
kill 'em all if they gossip

The Children of the Corn,
they vandalizing

The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins

Constantly drinking and drive,
hit the powder then watch this flame

That arrive in his eye,
listen coward, the concept is aim

And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head,
the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough

Compton, U.S.A.
made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

‚Äì Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn! You ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for? Niggas always acting unsensitive and shit

‚Äì Nigga, that ain't no word

‚Äì Nigga, Shut up! Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga? Don't even trip, just lay back and drink that
Martin had a dream

Martin had a dream

Kendrick have a dream
All my life I want money and power

Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower

So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing
Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating,
shooters go after Judas

Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches

Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record

That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rolling,
I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden,
so fuck y'all, I goes in and
It's go time,
I roll in dough with a good grind,
and I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet,
they say, "K, you going marry mines"

Beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, okay
I'm never living life confined, it's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time

Beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch
I look like OJ, killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy popping and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat

C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbing in the street, yelling
Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have

And you're gonna pay for it

I don't know if I can stop myself

And you're gonna pay for it
Oh, you'll never learn

I touch fire, little burn

This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have

And you're gonna pay for it
It's a heavy load, I stroll on a bumpy road

No jacket when I was cold, becomin' one with my soul
Stand toe to toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes
No weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it

You playin' with fire, burnin' you slow, hold up
I hear the whispers wishin', it's all cheap voodoo

I keep it cool to keep from goin' coo-coo

With a cal, aimin' at fake smiles and turn them upside down
Came too far for my feet to fail me

Lord, if I'm wrong you can help me now, hold up

Wait a minute, what am I sayin'?
The Devil, he busy, tryna get me everyday in every way

I won't let up, I won't shut up
You can't stop me, you won't knock me, ten-four, now copy
Live almighty, my declaration been written

In hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen
I tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance

Been dissectin' your motormouth, 'til I break down the engine
This ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman

See my opponent then, cease your existence
Endin' our friendship, baby, I'd rather die alone

Your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?
Capture your audience with these words, boy

The holy Chapel, the tabernacle, the book of Matthew

And Jesus starin' at you, take your turn, boy
See? It's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me

See? It's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me, I never die
My pedigree apparently only to idolize

Ahead of me is only my future and idle time
Longevity, I gotta get used to makin' you mine

You tellin' me I only get used to livin' if fine
You can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die

But I will never die, my legacy is alive
I die to get it off my chest, push words, just like weight

I got to eat, 'til it shows on my face
Tragedy turn to triumph, I'm tryin' just to relate

Jumpin' off of them towers, I'm takin' that leap of faith

Playin' at high stakes
Now when I speak, their pupils, they'll dilate

Through speakers'll vibrate
Know you feelin' the vibe, that vine couldn't relate

This next clip is long, a son of a gun, big numbers
Do the math, now cover the sum

I come from the slums, we come for the funds
Like runnin', under the sun where niggas livin' their life blunted
Countin' the ones, but truthfully nothin' like hundreds

Keep it one hundred
Roadblock in front of me, Look, I'm runnin' through it

Stick and move it, sippin' that Hennessy

This my gutter fluid, nothin' to it
What we lost, we gon' make it back

Like it wasn't missin', now listen, you 'bout to pay for that
Dum-da-de-da

Do, do, do, do, do, do

(Coming down, dripping candy on the groun')
It's that Yonc√©, your Yonc√©

In that lingerie, on that chardonnay

Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever like Bun B
And I'm Redboned yo
I'm really rit like Donjae

I'm camo in here yo
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake

Boy, you know I look good as fuck

Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no

We escalating, up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down

When it's a billion dollars on an elevator

Of course sometimes shit go down

When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

You wake up, flawless

I want everyone to feel like this tonight

Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me

Propofol, I know they hope I fall
But tell ‚Äòem winning is my motherfuckin‚Äô protocol
‚ÄòCause I score before I ever throw the ball

Mayday, mayday, earth to bitches
Slap these hoes on they ass, like we birthing bitches, UHN!
The queen of rap, slayin' with Queen B
If you ain‚Äôt on the team, you playin‚Äô for team D

I said come here, let me show you how this cookie taste

This that "Yeah, nigga, eat the cookie" face
(Right, right, right)
Mustard on the beat, ho
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion

Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do

Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even

Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em

Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em

Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
Won‚Äôt tell em how you hit the ground with it
Girl you know I‚Äôm from Chicago,
 I act a fool, Bobby Brown with it
You got gifts bring em down the south pole
Girl, he fufu with it
But you know I know what to do with it
I'll give you that, girl, I'm talking laps

As if you got a pool in it
You know you feeling how your boy press play

Just keep that ass rewindin'
Throw it up 9-3-4, 8-6-1-6

I gotta missed call from your bitch
She wanna' suck my dick, and I'm cool with it

I like girls in the shower, when its winter fresh
It‚Äôs that Twitter pussy I met on the Internet

On my late-night thirsty, ‚Äòcause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no bailin
I keep a stack of hundreds like I keep a secret
If anything you were just exploring, you wasn‚Äôt cheating
She got my number stored under fake names

Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos

And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho
Bobby, bitch, oh, you ain't know?

Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I‚Äôm just not as strong as I once was
When we‚Äôre together lately I don‚Äôt even feel a buzz
I‚Äôm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go

Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I‚Äôm wondering what I‚Äôm paying for
All these other bitches on my dick but I can‚Äôt fuck with that

You the only girl I need I gotta have you back

Even though you turn my lungs black

Tell me where you've been jack
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name Mary

I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that‚Äôs what I thought at first

Me and you together swear to god I saw that work
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work

Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years, goddamn took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go

What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can‚Äôt fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it‚Äôs outrageous

All I know is I‚Äôm living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, can‚Äôt forget the times shared

Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won‚Äôt

I look away but my head don‚Äôt
I love it when you‚Äôre fresh

I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki

But I love it when I feed you, Nikki

I hate that I bleed for you

Uh, I long and I need for you

But I love it when I taste you

Nothing can replace you

I wish I could erase you, you‚Äôre everywhere I go

But you‚Äôre everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don‚Äôt seem to understand

I‚Äôm just a man they always ask what‚Äôs wrong with me
Man you‚Äôre everything I crave

You‚Äôre the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I‚Äôm a king, you‚Äôre my Coretta
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine
Slave for the

Said I‚Äôm a slave for the nicotine

Been a slave for ya

I‚Äôm a muthafuckin slave for ya

Slave for the nicotine

Nikki, Nikki slave for ya

I‚Äôm a slave for ya Nikki

I‚Äôm a muthafuckin slave for ya
All handwriting on the album's artwork was done by Big Lenbo
No matter what you say or what you do

When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you

Fuck these other niggas

I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone,
got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva,
iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future

'til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it,
so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine,
or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs,
got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo

All of them people my kinfolk,
at least I think so, can't tell
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care,
it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping,
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special,
and if I lose my mental

Just hold my hand,
even if you don't understand, hold up
We did it! Yay!
Nigga, you so thirsty
Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok
Got her hair done, French braids now she A$AP
Bino so insensitive, she asking, "Why you say that?!"
I'm chillin', real nigga feeling
Rich kid, asshole: paint me as a villain
Still spitting that cash flow: DJ Khaled
I got a penthouse on both coasts: pH balance
Real nigga, I rep those, why though? Cause I said so
Hip deep in the Pepto,
I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo,
you faker than some Sweet'N Low
Yeah, you got some silverware, but really are you eating though?

Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so e-m-o?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese,
yo' girl, she jocking these

No hands like soccer teams
and y'all fuck boys like Socrates
You niggas ain't copping these, niggas ain't looking like me

Nah, I ain't checking I.D. but I bounce 'em with no problem
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)

Rich kid, asshole, paint me as a villain
Whaaat
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you (x3)

Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do?
Different color, my passport, Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my day wear
and your girl drink my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair (silver spoon coon, ho)
Ain't nobody sicker and my Fisker, "vroom, vroom," ho

Ain't nobody--

(Fiskers don't make noise when they start up...just so you know)
Top of the Hold 'em totem, ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules,
tripping off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
and I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that a-k-a
White hood, white hood, (okay-kay-kay)
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
So Maserati, you whipping a Kia
Spending this money, it's longer than Nia

Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Waking up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dope man, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her

"Err-err-err-err": onomatopoeia,
oh, I got my cool on! (tailormade)
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs

In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get

(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)

Girl, we should just get

(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)
Life is great when you‚Äôre naked, you press the gas and I break it

And lots of liquor, tell her "fuck me like you hate me"

"You love me?" I said maybe

And I say "go down, don't be lazy"
She love me for my drive, I love her cause she drive me crazy
OVO I ride, OMO I ride

Reps Up, them my niggas from the Scarborough side
Don‚Äôt fuck with them, or hollow tips will fly

Lot of people say it in a song just to say it, man, I‚Äôm not that type of guy
Hit me on the cell
I just might bring you to the city, send you home with stories you can never tell
I‚Äôm tryna break you out of your shell (And what?)
You just turned 21 like Adele, that‚Äôs good with me
I put my business on hold, let me turn off the phone

Let‚Äôs explore the unknown
If you not drinking with me you force me to turn up alone
No peer pressure,
I just know you like to get in your zone
You say that you‚Äôd rather smoke

Well, let me call up OB‚Äôs room and tell ‚Äòem roll up a cone

I know he probably got that extra special

I never second guess it
How's Villanova? What classes you taking next semester?

Man, she like "fuck the small talk"

I‚Äôm not here to discuss extra credits or my professors

We both young and misguided, but that‚Äôs another story, yeah

Bought a castle with my last deal

Salutations to my old hoes

And thank you for your participation
No chaser for my girl though

She go harder than me on occasion

Gettin' wasted with my girl
Then we 69 'til we need ventilation
You don't know about it
Gotta open new accounts cause the others overcrowded
Gotta open up the stores when they're closed when we shoppin'

For my girl, wear the clothes that ain't nobody rockin'
She so bad, I don't know what to do with her

I know just what to do in her
Homies hit me up, they said they're goin' out tonight

I said I'm with my girl, tonight I can't fuck with you niggas

I'mma take kare of her
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see

I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me

I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it

You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it

I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home

Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home
You're the girl, you're the one
I think there's something, baby

I think there's something, baby

Let a nigga try me, try me

Fuck around and I'm a catch a body
Bullets to his face, police call for backup
And just because I rap

Niggas need grammys, they straight actors
Free RondoNumbaNine he just caught a body
RIP to Nuski, my cousin called me
And since my car white they'll swear I'm racist
Niggas snitching here, he'll get his face lift
Even rappers know we ain't who to play with
And since I got my deal, I feel important

I live what I rap and just record it
They tried to give me 10 if I didn't have a lawyer
Niggas out here snitching, they're straight informers
Try Me! Try Me!

Bullets got his name on it like a ID
Sipping on the lean is like my IV
My crazy life, I feel like YG

Money in the mattress, bet she wanna get involved
She hopped on the blunt,
 said, where the hookah y'all?

I tell her pass back, if the shit too strong
It's all set, Mozart art on the block, so wet
Looking at your future, baby, put down the cigarette
Come hop on this kush jet and take flight
You with Aladdin, bet I got a magic carpet for that ass, yes
I'm also on one,

Big homie, Young Thugger Thugger, rollin'
Rolls Royce so shorty
Ben Frank baddies in the Benz waggin'

Lifestyles like this, gon' need magnums
Pass baby,
 welcome to rich class, baby
You all Maybelline, with ya new Celine
Audemars on lean, cars on sheen
It's verified, they ain't on your sea level
Watered eyes, don't cry, inhale and breathe regular

My baby on it,
Body shape, figure eight, like Picasso draw ya
Oh, yes, I'm winnin', bling kingin', ring blingin'
Like, like, for no reason, let's get closer, closed in

Remove your clothes, we close friends
Don't get choked smoking OG Oakland, shout out Oakland
Feels like a close, it's coming to, fuck am I gonna do?

It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is

Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along

From the day the song called, ‚Äò‚ÄôHi! My Name Is‚Äô‚Äô dropped

Started thinking my name was Fault

Cause any time things went wrong

I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the e-quivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue, it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft

And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws

And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant, that I went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain

I thought

No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught

Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?

So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised up on

But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it... ah

Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is

If there's anyone else that can relate to my story

Bet you feel the same way I felt

When I was in the same place you are

When I was afraid to‚Ä¶
I was a... afraid to make a single sound

Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found,I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for every word, so here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is near, guts over fear, I shed a tear

For all the times I let you push me around

And let you keep me down

Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear
I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents

Hate your appearance

Did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on

But it wasn't until I put the pain in song, learned who to aim it on

That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck

Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused

But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing

And there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen, cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from

Just a bunch of playful songs, that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song

But I rather make ‚ÄúNot Afraid 2‚Äù

Than make another motherfucking ‚ÄúWe Made You‚Äù, uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent

When I discuss my lows and my highs

My demise and my uprise, pray to God

I just opened enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools

To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt

Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, cause that gave me the

Strength to cause Shady-mania
so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house

And a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted

I represent him or her, anyone similar

You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk

Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on  through you when I‚Äôm gone
And to think I was a...
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches,
that's my fucking problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
Hold up, bitches simmer down
Taking hella long, bitch give it to me now
Make that thing pop like a semi or a nine
Ooh baby like it raw with the shimmy shimmy ya
Huh, A$AP get like me
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me
Put the chrome to your dome, make you sweat like Keith
Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga, like how you figure?
Getting figures and fuckin' bitches,
she rolling Swishers

Brought her bitches,
I brought my niggas, they getting bent up off the liquor
She love my licorice, I let her lick it
They say money make a nigga act nigger-ish
But least a nigga nigga rich
I be fucking broads like I be fucking bored
Turn a dyke bitch out, have her fucking boys, beast
Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju.. (Okay, I got it)

Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion

I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes Lord,
I don't really say this often
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talkin',
I'm beast
Yeah ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist

Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz-is-to-Me-Just-a-Car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par

See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah

Holla back I'll do ya, beast
That‚Äôs immaturity showing, its just the baby in you

One of the reasons why I never put a baby in you
Tired of hearing how you‚Äôll never trust me again

How you love me, then you hate me, then you love me again

One minute I‚Äôm your soul-mate then it‚Äôs fuck me again

Until you get horny enough and wanna fuck me again
I had never knew you thought like that (damn)
Who knew you was into sports like that

More prayers because they all players
With me you get an attitude, you get all stuck up

Start calling me a fuck up until I tell you shut the fuck up
But I wanna spend the rest of my life with you

Make a wife with you, make it alright with you
I got the gas and the coke

I don't sell molly no more

I keep the white and the green

And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean
OG pimping, trench coat mobbing
West coast Makonnen, the best thing going

They really like my movies is the best thing showing
Sell the whole pack then relax before the day end
Big smoking, PCH coasting
Sherantino  Hotel pent house toasting
When Straw-ber-ita dreams turn to champagne reality
Yeah, livin' life like this

Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this

Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just cause

Type of shit I see and probably wonder what it was
I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug

Basedheads coming through looking for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area

Beautiful by day, by night its hysteria

Fuck around and bury ya tonight

Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know

Living life to the fullest, I got to blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib

In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
God damn, what it feel like, middle of the night

Waking up, scared for my life
When the gat go blat (GunShots) like that
Guarantee you it‚Äôs a wrap, finna put you on your back

Like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Got to leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh

Just stop, stop, stop

‚Äòfore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props

Tell me why another body even got to drop

Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

"Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight."
Living life like this, hope little Bobby never fight like this

Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this

Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give but I never had the chance

Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out

If you want it Imma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out

Every night what I pray about

What I pray about, check it uh yeah
Got a son on the way

But I cling to the streets even though I want to run away
I imagine a better life

Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the- (Gunshots) -
in the dead of night
Selling crack to my own pops

Pushing this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house

If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance cause I need that shit and don‚Äôt give a fuck

Take the chance cause I need that shit and don‚Äôt give a fuck
Get down or lay down

Hit you with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Living how I'm living with the life that I'm given
Anybody that‚Äôs riding with me, I‚Äôm riding with them
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit em

The second I bit 'em, I get 'em, and hit 'em with the venom
Ain‚Äôt no need to pretend I'ma never do it

I knew it, already been through it

I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life

Anybody that's gang related

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Got a shit-eatin' grin

Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again

We're in Sin City

Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope
Diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your frigity-friends

I'm looking at your bum-stickity-bum, hun
The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack

And you can get the fickity-finger; the middle

You little dizzy bitch, eatin' spaghetti again
Got a 6 o'clock craving, stop, get Ciroc

It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in

Hit the spot, spot my next victim

I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit

Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies

I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear
But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha)
What are you: pit, rott, mixed?

Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then, let's lip-lock

If not then, chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat

Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog

Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'

My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like this shit's hoppin'

And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac

Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this

If not then kick rocks in flip flops
And I produced the track

So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'mma keep on saying

All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for saying

And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again

Like chopping 'til I'm dropping, still if that don't do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will
They saying I must bring it as Mohammad until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain

And made me Robin Williams crazy

Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist

Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertaining

I ain't stopping till be sprayed it

Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shaking

But before I tie a rope around this nob

If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until -
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking...

What's it called again? I'm blanking
The thing above the balls between my legs and I think I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny

Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging

Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe

It's past time, like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage

Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit

Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis, chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits

And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet, at least that's what her train of thought is
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it, quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers

And I always end up giving these bitches some complex

And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart

And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits

Now grab this Cuisinart

And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite

And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)

Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?

I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick

Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks

To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit

Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace,
I got M√ºnchhausen by proxy

I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me

You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre

Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car

And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind

And it tastes like humble pie

So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee

Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy

You gon' blow that rape whistle on me

(Squee!) I love it
'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off

Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway and try not to get lost

'Till we get to Las Vegas
Whatever happens here, stays here

So let's go all the way dear

Til we get to Las Vegas
Whatever happens in my room, it stays in my room like movie night like cable
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days

In 7 nights in the days and it's our Vegas
We rolling circles and packs, we the lifesavers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then

I'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving

And I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors

And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Next ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store

With a about a million dollars with your mama

And sat down did an ALS challenge,
haaaan

I stole that adlib from French,
Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again

About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sitting on a bike in the sand

If you ain't been through nothing

Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lamp
Weed got her so chinky eyed

Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking

Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss

If this is my passion

I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence

The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listening to

Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits

Bitch, get the fuck out of my face

To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there

And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum

Even though I have an affinity for witty banter

Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
I knock a nigga face off

Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever..)
I leave the club with my tab still open

Won't even get a cab for you and your friend

The only fear I have is of loathing

And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas
Dites-moi d'o√π il vient

Enfin je saurai o√π je vais

Maman dit que lorsqu'on cherche bien

On finit toujours par trouver

Maman dit "travailler c'est bien"

Bien mieux qu'√™tre mal accompagn√©

Tout le monde sait comment on fait les b√©b√©s

Monsieur Je-sais-tout en aurait h√©rit√©, c'est √ßa
Faut l'sucer d'son pouce ou quoi ?

Paroles r√©dig√©es et expliqu√©es par la communaut√© Rap Genius France
I'm the only one that get the job done

I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me

She don't love me like she say she love me

Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all

Believe me
Yeah, rip, rip rip

It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick

Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip

God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?

Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know

When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back

And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though

I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team till Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga

Yeah
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga

One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with

Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant

I must be doin' somethin'
Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'

We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance

V Live just took me for a cheque

"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Motherfuck award shows and motherfuck the press like that
Motherfuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck

Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day

On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw motherfuckin' roses at my feet, nigga

I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done

I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach

She look like she got a bun in the oven from me

Preheat,
believe me

All you gotta do is pay me every week

I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone
Rip rip, nigga
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)

Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)

Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)

Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask,
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows

Some people wanna fit in with the popular,
that was my problem
I was in a dark room,
loud tunes,
looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up,
I see the crowd mood

Changin' by the minute
and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me:
"Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch

First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it

Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it"
and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice

Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me:
I ride, you ride, bang

One chopper, one hundred shots, bang

Hop out, do you bang?

Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
(Sherane)
Aw man... where is she taking me...

Where is she taking me...
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got Hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?

If it do then you're like me, 
making excuse that your relief

Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?

I probably sleep and never ever wake up

Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a 
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't tripping

We gon' do the same ol' shit

I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways

Fall right in ----'s lap

And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, aye I see somebody
Aha! Got them niggas, K-dot, you good?

L----, you good?
Yeah blood, I'm good,
Dave, you good?

Dave? Dave, say something - Dave?

These bitch ass niggas killed my brother!
I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl

Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face

Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
I don't know how you feel can you tell me

I won't know how you feel 'til you tell me
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy
Is it cause I'm a star
It maybe could be my star status
My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
What's on your mind? I'm not Ginuwine
Gotta pay that cost to be a boss
I put on my Louboutins playing golf
Young nigga walking with Nina Ross
I'm dropping the bombs like Viet Cong
They say I'm picky cause all my bitches exquisite
I'm in some vintage Givenchy smokin' a Philly
The dope that I sell is the purest

The junkies they hit it, they scratchin' and itchin'
The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'

My nigga you know we invented it
Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant
I got the boot but no Timberland
I am the plug, you the middle man
I never leave my niggas starvin'

You niggas mistake me for Marvin
Is it my looks or is it my wealth?

Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
Bitches be saying I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lotta money
She sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses, baby girl you trippin'
I know why you came in this club tonight

Looking for a nigga that's gon' change your life
Me and my niggas tryna git it, ya bish
Hit the house lick, tell me is you wit' it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive

From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do

Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish

The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish

And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter

But the one in front of the gun lives forever

(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way

Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel

Nah, a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel

Nah, nah, a dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel

Nah, a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel
Dreams of living life like rappers do

Bump that new E-40 after school
You know big balling with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish

Another casualty of war, ya bish

Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head

He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same

A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerking
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirting
Gang signs out the window, ya bish

Hoping all of them offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold

And we gon' crash it when nobody's home
Be the last one out to get this dough, no way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes, no way
Hit the streets then we break the code, no way
Hit the brakes when they on patrol, no way
Imagine Rock up in them projects

Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spillin', pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping

Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga

I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do

When you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em

Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands

Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash

If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut,
them serpents lurking, blood

Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs, but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees

Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree
K‚Äôs Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren‚Äôt gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house man. This man, on one, he feeling good as a mother fucker. Shit, I‚Äôm trynna get my thing going too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feeling good. Look, listen to him

K‚Äôs Dad: Girl, Girl, I want your body, I want your body, cause of that big ol‚Äô fat ass. Girl, Girl, I want your body, I want your body, cause of that big ol‚Äô fat ass

K‚Äôs Mom: See he high as hell, and he ain‚Äôt even tripping off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back

K‚Äôs Dad: Did somebody say dominoes?
To grow old in my arms, oh, girl

Take all, can't stop, my love
Everything she was doin' was cool, but it ain't Ralph though
Might have gave me head in the pool, that ain't your mouth though
Might have caught you clappin' every Sunday at church

You still ratchet cause they play your favorite song and you twerk
Designer purse on your arm, 'bout the size of a duffle bag
And them brand new titties cost a couple racks
Feelin' on a girl's ass with a troubled past

Chainsmokin' every day, at least a couple packs
You know I always hit you deeper than a baritone
Bone you with my jewelry on, that's a herringbone
Hotter than Arizon', fresher than aerosol
These condom rappin' ass niggas wasn't ever raw
It's aiight but it ain't Ralph though
And unless your money talkin' keep your mouth closed
We smokin' indo outdoor, in Palo Alto
If this party ain't got hoes, my intro's my outro
Please spend the night forever

The silence in my room is louder than kaboom
Let's skip the north freeze for the southern breeze
The grass is always greener when there's bumblebees
She cooked up a salt fish and I fry the bake
Dresses by Margiela,
jewelry by Jenavi
We'll have epiphanies, take you to Tiffany's
